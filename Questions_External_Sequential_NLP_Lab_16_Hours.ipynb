coming home\\n      With pulpy figs and wine from Sicily\\n   Stood at his galley’s prow, and let the foam\\n      Blow through his crisp brown curls unconsciously,\\n   And holding wave and wind in boy’s despite\\n   Peered from his dripping seat across the wet and stormy night.\\n\\n   Till with the dawn he saw a burnished spear\\n      Like a thin thread of gold against the sky,\\n   And hoisted sail, and strained the creaking gear,\\n      And bade the pilot head her lustily\\n   Against the nor’west gale, and all day long\\n   Held on his way, and marked the rowers’ time with measured song.\\n\\n   And when the faint Corinthian hills were red\\n      Dropped anchor in a little sandy bay,\\n   And with fresh boughs of olive crowned his head,\\n      And brushed from cheek and throat the hoary spray,\\n   And washed his limbs with oil, and from the hold\\n   Brought out his linen tunic and his sandals brazen-soled,\\n\\n   And a rich robe stained with the fishers’ juice\\n      Which of some swarthy trader he had bought\\n   Upon the sunny quay at Syracuse,\\n      And was with Tyrian broideries inwrought,\\n   And by the questioning merchants made his way\\n   Up through the soft and silver woods, and when the labouring day\\n\\n   Had spun its tangled web of crimson cloud,\\n      Clomb the high hill, and with swift silent feet\\n   Crept to the fane unnoticed by the crowd\\n      Of busy priests, and from some dark retreat\\n   Watched the young swains his frolic playmates bring\\n   The firstling of their little flock, and the shy shepherd fling\\n\\n   The crackling salt upon the flame, or hang\\n      His studded crook against the temple wall\\n   To Her who keeps away the ravenous fang\\n      Of the base wolf from homestead and from stall;\\n   And then the clear-voiced maidens ’gan to sing,\\n   And to the altar each man brought some goodly offering,\\n\\n   A beechen cup brimming with milky foam,\\n      A fair cloth wrought with cunning imagery\\n   Of hounds in chase, a waxen honey-comb\\n      Dripping with oozy gold which scarce the bee\\n   Had ceased from building, a black skin of oil\\n   Meet for the wrestlers, a great boar the fierce and white-tusked spoil\\n\\n   Stolen from Artemis that jealous maid\\n      To please Athena, and the dappled hide\\n   Of a tall stag who in some mountain glade\\n      Had met the shaft; and then the herald cried,\\n   And from the pillared precinct one by one\\n   Went the glad Greeks well pleased that they their simple vows had\\n   done.\\n\\n   And the old priest put out the waning fires\\n      Save that one lamp whose restless ruby glowed\\n   For ever in the cell, and the shrill lyres\\n      Came fainter on the wind, as down the road\\n   In joyous dance these country folk did pass,\\n   And with stout hands the warder closed the gates of polished brass.\\n\\n   Long time he lay and hardly dared to breathe,\\n      And heard the cadenced drip of spilt-out wine,\\n   And the rose-petals falling from the wreath\\n      As the night breezes wandered through the shrine,\\n   And seemed to be in some entrancèd swoon\\n   Till through the open roof above the full and brimming moon\\n\\n   Flooded with sheeny waves the marble floor,\\n      When from his nook up leapt the venturous lad,\\n   And flinging wide the cedar-carven door\\n      Beheld an awful image saffron-clad\\n   And armed for battle! the gaunt Griffin glared\\n   From the huge helm, and the long lance of wreck and ruin flared\\n\\n   Like a red rod of flame, stony and steeled\\n      The Gorgon’s head its leaden eyeballs rolled,\\n   And writhed its snaky horrors through the shield,\\n      And gaped aghast with bloodless lips and cold\\n   In passion impotent, while with blind gaze\\n   The blinking owl between the feet hooted in shrill amaze.\\n\\n   The lonely fisher as he trimmed his lamp\\n      Far out at sea off Sunium, or cast\\n   The net for tunnies, heard a brazen tramp\\n      Of horses smite the waves, and a wild blast\\n   Divide the folded curtains of the night,\\n   And knelt upon the little poop, and prayed in holy fright.\\n\\n   And guilty lovers in their venery\\n      Forgat a little while their stolen sweets,\\n   Deeming they heard dread Dian’s bitter cry;\\n      And the grim watchmen on their lofty seats\\n   Ran to their shields in haste precipitate,\\n   Or strained black-bearded throats across the dusky parapet.\\n\\n   For round the temple rolled the clang of arms,\\n      And the twelve Gods leapt up in marble fear,\\n   And the air quaked with dissonant alarums\\n      Till huge Poseidon shook his mighty spear,\\n   And on the frieze the prancing horses neighed,\\n   And the low tread of hurrying feet rang from the cavalcade.\\n\\n   Ready for death with parted lips he stood,\\n      And well content at such a price to see\\n   That calm wide brow, that terrible maidenhood,\\n      The marvel of that pitiless chastity,\\n   Ah! well content indeed, for never wight\\n   Since Troy’s young shepherd prince had seen so wonderful a sight.\\n\\n   Ready for death he stood, but lo! the air\\n      Grew silent, and the horses ceased to neigh,\\n   And off his brow he tossed the clustering hair,\\n      And from his limbs he throw the cloak away;\\n   For whom would not such love make desperate?\\n   And nigher came, and touched her throat, and with hands violate\\n\\n   Undid the cuirass, and the crocus gown,\\n      And bared the breasts of polished ivory,\\n   Till from the waist the peplos falling down\\n      Left visible the secret mystery\\n   Which to no lover will Athena show,\\n   The grand cool flanks, the crescent thighs, the bossy hills of snow.\\n\\n   Those who have never known a lover’s sin\\n      Let them not read my ditty, it will be\\n   To their dull ears so musicless and thin\\n      That they will have no joy of it, but ye\\n   To whose wan cheeks now creeps the lingering smile,\\n   Ye who have learned who Eros is,—O listen yet awhile.\\n\\n   A little space he let his greedy eyes\\n      Rest on the burnished image, till mere sight\\n   Half swooned for surfeit of such luxuries,\\n      And then his lips in hungering delight\\n   Fed on her lips, and round the towered neck\\n   He flung his arms, nor cared at all his passion’s will to check.\\n\\n   Never I ween did lover hold such tryst,\\n      For all night long he murmured honeyed word,\\n   And saw her sweet unravished limbs, and kissed\\n      Her pale and argent body undisturbed,\\n   And paddled with the polished throat, and pressed\\n   His hot and beating heart upon her chill and icy breast.\\n\\n   It was as if Numidian javelins\\n      Pierced through and through his wild and whirling brain,\\n   And his nerves thrilled like throbbing violins\\n      In exquisite pulsation, and the pain\\n   Was such sweet anguish that he never drew\\n   His lips from hers till overhead the lark of warning flew.\\n\\n   They who have never seen the daylight peer\\n      Into a darkened room, and drawn the curtain,\\n   And with dull eyes and wearied from some dear\\n      And worshipped body risen, they for certain\\n   Will never know of what I try to sing,\\n   How long the last kiss was, how fond and late his lingering.\\n\\n   The moon was girdled with a crystal rim,\\n      The sign which shipmen say is ominous\\n   Of wrath in heaven, the wan stars were dim,\\n      And the low lightening east was tremulous\\n   With the faint fluttering wings of flying dawn,\\n   Ere from the silent sombre shrine his lover had withdrawn.\\n\\n   Down the steep rock with hurried feet and fast\\n      Clomb the brave lad, and reached the cave of Pan,\\n   And heard the goat-foot snoring as he passed,\\n      And leapt upon a grassy knoll and ran\\n   Like a young fawn unto an olive wood\\n   Which in a shady valley by the well-built city stood;\\n\\n   And sought a little stream, which well he knew,\\n      For oftentimes with boyish careless shout\\n   The green and crested grebe he would pursue,\\n      Or snare in woven net the silver trout,\\n   And down amid the startled reeds he lay\\n   Panting in breathless sweet affright, and waited for the day.\\n\\n   On the green bank he lay, and let one hand\\n      Dip in the cool dark eddies listlessly,\\n   And soon the breath of morning came and fanned\\n      His hot flushed cheeks, or lifted wantonly\\n   The tangled curls from off his forehead, while\\n   He on the running water gazed with strange and secret smile.\\n\\n   And soon the shepherd in rough woollen cloak\\n      With his long crook undid the wattled cotes,\\n   And from the stack a thin blue wreath of smoke\\n      Curled through the air across the ripening oats,\\n   And on the hill the yellow house-dog bayed\\n   As through the crisp and rustling fern the heavy cattle strayed.\\n\\n   And when the light-foot mower went afield\\n      Across the meadows laced with threaded dew,\\n   And the sheep bleated on the misty weald,\\n      And from its nest the waking corncrake flew,\\n   Some woodmen saw him lying by the stream\\n   And marvelled much that any lad so beautiful could seem,\\n\\n   Nor deemed him born of mortals, and one said,\\n      ‘It is young Hylas, that false runaway\\n   Who with a Naiad now would make his bed\\n      Forgetting Herakles,’ but others, ‘Nay,\\n   It is Narcissus, his own paramour,\\n   Those are the fond and crimson lips no woman can allure.’\\n\\n   And when they nearer came a third one cried,\\n      ‘It is young Dionysos who has hid\\n   His spear and fawnskin by the river side\\n      Weary of hunting with the Bassarid,\\n   And wise indeed were we away to fly:\\n   They live not long who on the gods immortal come to spy.’\\n\\n   So turned they back, and feared to look behind,\\n      And told the timid swain how they had seen\\n   Amid the reeds some woodland god reclined,\\n      And no man dared to cross the open green,\\n   And on that day no olive-tree was slain,\\n   Nor rushes cut, but all deserted was the fair domain,\\n\\n   Save when the neat-herd’s lad, his empty pail\\n      Well slung upon his back, with leap and bound\\n   Raced on the other side, and stopped to hail,\\n      Hoping that he some comrade new had found,\\n   And gat no answer, and then half afraid\\n   Passed on his simple way, or down the still and silent glade\\n\\n   A little girl ran laughing from the farm,\\n      Not thinking of love’s secret mysteries,\\n   And when she saw the white and gleaming arm\\n      And all his manlihood, with longing eyes\\n   Whose passion mocked her sweet virginity\\n   Watched him awhile, and then stole back sadly and wearily.\\n\\n   Far off he heard the city’s hum and noise,\\n      And now and then the shriller laughter where\\n   The passionate purity of brown-limbed boys\\n      Wrestled or raced in the clear healthful air,\\n   And now and then a little tinkling bell\\n   As the shorn wether led the sheep down to the mossy well.\\n\\n   Through the grey willows danced the fretful gnat,\\n      The grasshopper chirped idly from the tree,\\n   In sleek and oily coat the water-rat\\n      Breasting the little ripples manfully\\n   Made for the wild-duck’s nest, from bough to bough\\n   Hopped the shy finch, and the huge tortoise crept across the slough.\\n\\n   On the faint wind floated the silky seeds\\n      As the bright scythe swept through the waving grass,\\n   The ouzel-cock splashed circles in the reeds\\n      And flecked with silver whorls the forest’s glass,\\n   Which scarce had caught again its imagery\\n   Ere from its bed the dusky tench leapt at the dragon-fly.\\n\\n   But little care had he for any thing\\n      Though up and down the beech the squirrel played,\\n   And from the copse the linnet ’gan to sing\\n      To its brown mate its sweetest serenade;\\n   Ah! little care indeed, for he had seen\\n   The breasts of Pallas and the naked wonder of the Queen.\\n\\n   But when the herdsman called his straggling goats\\n      With whistling pipe across the rocky road,\\n   And the shard-beetle with its trumpet-notes\\n      Boomed through the darkening woods, and seemed to bode\\n   Of coming storm, and the belated crane\\n   Passed homeward like a shadow, and the dull big drops of rain\\n\\n   Fell on the pattering fig-leaves, up he rose,\\n      And from the gloomy forest went his way\\n   Past sombre homestead and wet orchard-close,\\n      And came at last unto a little quay,\\n   And called his mates aboard, and took his seat\\n   On the high poop, and pushed from land, and loosed the dripping sheet,\\n\\n   And steered across the bay, and when nine suns\\n      Passed down the long and laddered way of gold,\\n   And nine pale moons had breathed their orisons\\n      To the chaste stars their confessors, or told\\n   Their dearest secret to the downy moth\\n   That will not fly at noonday, through the foam and surging froth\\n\\n   Came a great owl with yellow sulphurous eyes\\n      And lit upon the ship, whose timbers creaked\\n   As though the lading of three argosies\\n      Were in the hold, and flapped its wings and shrieked,\\n   And darkness straightway stole across the deep,\\n   Sheathed was Orion’s sword, dread Mars himself fled down the steep,\\n\\n   And the moon hid behind a tawny mask\\n      Of drifting cloud, and from the ocean’s marge\\n   Rose the red plume, the huge and hornèd casque,\\n      The seven-cubit spear, the brazen targe!\\n   And clad in bright and burnished panoply\\n   Athena strode across the stretch of sick and shivering sea!\\n\\n   To the dull sailors’ sight her loosened looks\\n      Seemed like the jagged storm-rack, and her feet\\n   Only the spume that floats on hidden rocks,\\n      And, marking how the rising waters beat\\n   Against the rolling ship, the pilot cried\\n   To the young helmsman at the stern to luff to windward side\\n\\n   But he, the overbold adulterer,\\n      A dear profaner of great mysteries,\\n   An ardent amorous idolater,\\n      When he beheld those grand relentless eyes\\n   Laughed loud for joy, and crying out ‘I come’\\n   Leapt from the lofty poop into the chill and churning foam.\\n\\n   Then fell from the high heaven one bright star,\\n      One dancer left the circling galaxy,\\n   And back to Athens on her clattering car\\n      In all the pride of venged divinity\\n   Pale Pallas swept with shrill and steely clank,\\n   And a few gurgling bubbles rose where her boy lover sank.\\n\\n   And the mast shuddered as the gaunt owl flew\\n      With mocking hoots after the wrathful Queen,\\n   And the old pilot bade the trembling crew\\n      Hoist the big sail, and told how he had seen\\n   Close to the stern a dim and giant form,\\n   And like a dipping swallow the stout ship dashed through the storm.\\n\\n   And no man dared to speak of Charmides\\n      Deeming that he some evil thing had wrought,\\n   And when they reached the strait Symplegades\\n      They beached their galley on the shore, and sought\\n   The toll-gate of the city hastily,\\n   And in the market showed their brown and pictured pottery.\\n\\n                                     II.\\n\\n   BUT some good Triton-god had ruth, and bare\\n      The boy’s drowned body back to Grecian land,\\n   And mermaids combed his dank and dripping hair\\n      And smoothed his brow, and loosed his clenching hand;\\n   Some brought sweet spices from far Araby,\\n   And others bade the halcyon sing her softest lullaby.\\n\\n   And when he neared his old Athenian home,\\n      A mighty billow rose up suddenly\\n   Upon whose oily back the clotted foam\\n      Lay diapered in some strange fantasy,\\n   And clasping him unto its glassy breast\\n   Swept landward, like a white-maned steed upon a venturous quest!\\n\\n   Now where Colonos leans unto the sea\\n      There lies a long and level stretch of lawn;\\n   The rabbit knows it, and the mountain bee\\n      For it deserts Hymettus, and the Faun\\n   Is not afraid, for never through the day\\n   Comes a cry ruder than the shout of shepherd lads at play.\\n\\n   But often from the thorny labyrinth\\n      And tangled branches of the circling wood\\n   The stealthy hunter sees young Hyacinth\\n      Hurling the polished disk, and draws his hood\\n   Over his guilty gaze, and creeps away,\\n   Nor dares to wind his horn, or—else at the first break of day\\n\\n   The Dryads come and throw the leathern ball\\n      Along the reedy shore, and circumvent\\n   Some goat-eared Pan to be their seneschal\\n      For fear of bold Poseidon’s ravishment,\\n   And loose their girdles, with shy timorous eyes,\\n   Lest from the surf his azure arms and purple beard should rise.\\n\\n   On this side and on that a rocky cave,\\n      Hung with the yellow-belled laburnum, stands\\n   Smooth is the beach, save where some ebbing wave\\n      Leaves its faint outline etched upon the sands,\\n   As though it feared to be too soon forgot\\n   By the green rush, its playfellow,—and yet, it is a spot\\n\\n   So small, that the inconstant butterfly\\n      Could steal the hoarded money from each flower\\n   Ere it was noon, and still not satisfy\\n      Its over-greedy love,—within an hour\\n   A sailor boy, were he but rude enow\\n   To land and pluck a garland for his galley’s painted prow,\\n\\n   Would almost leave the little meadow bare,\\n      For it knows nothing of great pageantry,\\n   Only a few narcissi here and there\\n      Stand separate in sweet austerity,\\n   Dotting the unmown grass with silver stars,\\n   And here and there a daffodil waves tiny scimitars.\\n\\n   Hither the billow brought him, and was glad\\n      Of such dear servitude, and where the land\\n   Was virgin of all waters laid the lad\\n      Upon the golden margent of the strand,\\n   And like a lingering lover oft returned\\n   To kiss those pallid limbs which once with intense fire burned,\\n\\n   Ere the wet seas had quenched that holocaust,\\n      That self-fed flame, that passionate lustihead,\\n   Ere grisly death with chill and nipping frost\\n      Had withered up those lilies white and red\\n   Which, while the boy would through the forest range,\\n   Answered each other in a sweet antiphonal counter-change.\\n\\n   And when at dawn the wood-nymphs, hand-in-hand,\\n      Threaded the bosky dell, their satyr spied\\n   The boy’s pale body stretched upon the sand,\\n      And feared Poseidon’s treachery, and cried,\\n   And like bright sunbeams flitting through a glade\\n   Each startled Dryad sought some safe and leafy ambuscade.\\n\\n   Save one white girl, who deemed it would not be\\n      So dread a thing to feel a sea-god’s arms\\n   Crushing her breasts in amorous tyranny,\\n      And longed to listen to those subtle charms\\n   Insidious lovers weave when they would win\\n   Some fencèd fortress, and stole back again, nor thought it sin\\n\\n   To yield her treasure unto one so fair,\\n      And lay beside him, thirsty with love’s drouth,\\n   Called him soft names, played with his tangled hair,\\n      And with hot lips made havoc of his mouth\\n   Afraid he might not wake, and then afraid\\n   Lest he might wake too soon, fled back, and then, fond renegade,\\n\\n   Returned to fresh assault, and all day long\\n      Sat at his side, and laughed at her new toy,\\n   And held his hand, and sang her sweetest song,\\n      Then frowned to see how froward was the boy\\n   Who would not with her maidenhood entwine,\\n   Nor knew that three days since his eyes had looked on Proserpine;\\n\\n   Nor knew what sacrilege his lips had done,\\n      But said, ‘He will awake, I know him well,\\n   He will awake at evening when the sun\\n      Hangs his red shield on Corinth’s citadel;\\n   This sleep is but a cruel treachery\\n   To make me love him more, and in some cavern of the sea\\n\\n   Deeper than ever falls the fisher’s line\\n      Already a huge Triton blows his horn,\\n   And weaves a garland from the crystalline\\n      And drifting ocean-tendrils to adorn\\n   The emerald pillars of our bridal bed,\\n   For sphered in foaming silver, and with coral crownèd head,\\n\\n   We two will sit upon a throne of pearl,\\n      And a blue wave will be our canopy,\\n   And at our feet the water-snakes will curl\\n      In all their amethystine panoply\\n   Of diamonded mail, and we will mark\\n   The mullets swimming by the mast of some storm-foundered bark,\\n\\n   Vermilion-finned with eyes of bossy gold\\n      Like flakes of crimson light, and the great deep\\n   His glassy-portaled chamber will unfold,\\n      And we will see the painted dolphins sleep\\n   Cradled by murmuring halcyons on the rocks\\n   Where Proteus in quaint suit of green pastures his monstrous flocks.\\n\\n   And tremulous opal-hued anemones\\n      Will wave their purple fringes where we tread\\n   Upon the mirrored floor, and argosies\\n      Of fishes flecked with tawny scales will thread\\n   The drifting cordage of the shattered wreck,\\n   And honey-coloured amber beads our twining limbs will deck.’\\n\\n   But when that baffled Lord of War the Sun\\n      With gaudy pennon flying passed away\\n   Into his brazen House, and one by one\\n      The little yellow stars began to stray\\n   Across the field of heaven, ah! then indeed\\n   She feared his lips upon her lips would never care to feed,\\n\\n   And cried, ‘Awake, already the pale moon\\n      Washes the trees with silver, and the wave\\n   Creeps grey and chilly up this sandy dune,\\n      The croaking frogs are out, and from the cave\\n   The nightjar shrieks, the fluttering bats repass,\\n   And the brown stoat with hollow flanks creeps through the dusky grass.\\n\\n   Nay, though thou art a god, be not so coy,\\n      For in yon stream there is a little reed\\n   That often whispers how a lovely boy\\n      Lay with her once upon a grassy mead,\\n   Who when his cruel pleasure he had done\\n   Spread wings of rustling gold and soared aloft into the sun.\\n\\n   Be not so coy, the laurel trembles still\\n      With great Apollo’s kisses, and the fir\\n   Whose clustering sisters fringe the seaward hill\\n      Hath many a tale of that bold ravisher\\n   Whom men call Boreas, and I have seen\\n   The mocking eyes of Hermes through the poplar’s silvery sheen.\\n\\n   Even the jealous Naiads call me fair,\\n      And every morn a young and ruddy swain\\n   Woos me with apples and with locks of hair,\\n      And seeks to soothe my virginal disdain\\n   By all the gifts the gentle wood-nymphs love;\\n   But yesterday he brought to me an iris-plumaged dove\\n\\n   With little crimson feet, which with its store\\n      Of seven spotted eggs the cruel lad\\n   Had stolen from the lofty sycamore\\n      At daybreak, when her amorous comrade had\\n   Flown off in search of berried juniper\\n   Which most they love; the fretful wasp, that earliest vintager\\n\\n   Of the blue grapes, hath not persistency\\n      So constant as this simple shepherd-boy\\n   For my poor lips, his joyous purity\\n      And laughing sunny eyes might well decoy\\n   A Dryad from her oath to Artemis;\\n   For very beautiful is he, his mouth was made to kiss;\\n\\n   His argent forehead, like a rising moon\\n      Over the dusky hills of meeting brows,\\n   Is crescent shaped, the hot and Tyrian noon\\n      Leads from the myrtle-grove no goodlier spouse\\n   For Cytheræa, the first silky down\\n   Fringes his blushing cheeks, and his young limbs are strong and brown;\\n\\n   And he is rich, and fat and fleecy herds\\n      Of bleating sheep upon his meadows lie,\\n   And many an earthen bowl of yellow curds\\n      Is in his homestead for the thievish fly\\n   To swim and drown in, the pink clover mead\\n   Keeps its sweet store for him, and he can pipe on oaten reed.\\n\\n   And yet I love him not; it was for thee\\n      I kept my love; I knew that thou would’st come\\n   To rid me of this pallid chastity,\\n      Thou fairest flower of the flowerless foam\\n   Of all the wide Ægean, brightest star\\n   Of ocean’s azure heavens where the mirrored planets are!\\n\\n   I knew that thou would’st come, for when at first\\n      The dry wood burgeoned, and the sap of spring\\n   Swelled in my green and tender bark or burst\\n      To myriad multitudinous blossoming\\n   Which mocked the midnight with its mimic moons\\n   That did not dread the dawn, and first the thrushes’ rapturous tunes\\n\\n   Startled the squirrel from its granary,\\n      And cuckoo flowers fringed the narrow lane,\\n   Through my young leaves a sensuous ecstasy\\n      Crept like new wine, and every mossy vein\\n   Throbbed with the fitful pulse of amorous blood,\\n   And the wild winds of passion shook my slim stem’s maidenhood.\\n\\n   The trooping fawns at evening came and laid\\n      Their cool black noses on my lowest boughs,\\n   And on my topmost branch the blackbird made\\n      A little nest of grasses for his spouse,\\n   And now and then a twittering wren would light\\n   On a thin twig which hardly bare the weight of such delight.\\n\\n   I was the Attic shepherd’s trysting place,\\n      Beneath my shadow Amaryllis lay,\\n   And round my trunk would laughing Daphnis chase\\n      The timorous girl, till tired out with play\\n   She felt his hot breath stir her tangled hair,\\n   And turned, and looked, and fled no more from such delightful snare.\\n\\n   Then come away unto my ambuscade\\n      Where clustering woodbine weaves a canopy\\n   For amorous pleasaunce, and the rustling shade\\n      Of Paphian myrtles seems to sanctify\\n   The dearest rites of love; there in the cool\\n   And green recesses of its farthest depth there is pool,\\n\\n   The ouzel’s haunt, the wild bee’s pasturage,\\n      For round its rim great creamy lilies float\\n   Through their flat leaves in verdant anchorage,\\n      Each cup a white-sailed golden-laden boat\\n   Steered by a dragon-fly,—be not afraid\\n   To leave this wan and wave-kissed shore, surely the place was made\\n\\n   For lovers such as we; the Cyprian Queen,\\n      One arm around her boyish paramour,\\n   Strays often there at eve, and I have seen\\n      The moon strip off her misty vestiture\\n   For young Endymion’s eyes; be not afraid,\\n   The panther feet of Dian never tread that secret glade.\\n\\n   Nay if thou will’st, back to the beating brine,\\n      Back to the boisterous billow let us go,\\n   And walk all day beneath the hyaline\\n      Huge vault of Neptune’s watery portico,\\n   And watch the purple monsters of the deep\\n   Sport in ungainly play, and from his lair keen Xiphias leap.\\n\\n   For if my mistress find me lying here\\n      She will not ruth or gentle pity show,\\n   But lay her boar-spear down, and with austere\\n      Relentless fingers string the cornel bow,\\n   And draw the feathered notch against her breast,\\n   And loose the archèd cord; aye, even now upon the quest\\n\\n   I hear her hurrying feet,—awake, awake,\\n      Thou laggard in love’s battle! once at least\\n   Let me drink deep of passion’s wine, and slake\\n      My parchèd being with the nectarous feast\\n   Which even gods affect!  O come, Love, come,\\n   Still we have time to reach the cavern of thine azure home.’\\n\\n   Scarce had she spoken when the shuddering trees\\n      Shook, and the leaves divided, and the air\\n   Grew conscious of a god, and the grey seas\\n      Crawled backward, and a long and dismal blare\\n   Blew from some tasselled horn, a sleuth-hound bayed,\\n   And like a flame a barbèd reed flew whizzing down the glade.\\n\\n   And where the little flowers of her breast\\n      Just brake into their milky blossoming,\\n   This murderous paramour, this unbidden guest,\\n      Pierced and struck deep in horrid chambering,\\n   And ploughed a bloody furrow with its dart,\\n   And dug a long red road, and cleft with wingèd death her heart.\\n\\n   Sobbing her life out with a bitter cry\\n      On the boy’s body fell the Dryad maid,\\n   Sobbing for incomplete virginity,\\n      And raptures unenjoyed, and pleasures dead,\\n   And all the pain of things unsatisfied,\\n   And the bright drops of crimson youth crept down her throbbing side.\\n\\n   Ah! pitiful it was to hear her moan,\\n      And very pitiful to see her die\\n   Ere she had yielded up her sweets, or known\\n      The joy of passion, that dread mystery\\n   Which not to know is not to live at all,\\n   And yet to know is to be held in death’s most deadly thrall.\\n\\n   But as it hapt the Queen of Cythere,\\n      Who with Adonis all night long had lain\\n   Within some shepherd’s hut in Arcady,\\n      On team of silver doves and gilded wain\\n   Was journeying Paphos-ward, high up afar\\n   From mortal ken between the mountains and the morning star,\\n\\n   And when low down she spied the hapless pair,\\n      And heard the Oread’s faint despairing cry,\\n   Whose cadence seemed to play upon the air\\n      As though it were a viol, hastily\\n   She bade her pigeons fold each straining plume,\\n   And dropt to earth, and reached the strand, and saw their dolorous\\n   doom.\\n\\n   For as a gardener turning back his head\\n      To catch the last notes of the linnet, mows\\n   With careless scythe too near some flower bed,\\n      And cuts the thorny pillar of the rose,\\n   And with the flower’s loosened loneliness\\n   Strews the brown mould; or as some shepherd lad in wantonness\\n\\n   Driving his little flock along the mead\\n      Treads down two daffodils, which side by aide\\n   Have lured the lady-bird with yellow brede\\n      And made the gaudy moth forget its pride,\\n   Treads down their brimming golden chalices\\n   Under light feet which were not made for such rude ravages;\\n\\n   Or as a schoolboy tired of his book\\n      Flings himself down upon the reedy grass\\n   And plucks two water-lilies from the brook,\\n      And for a time forgets the hour glass,\\n   Then wearies of their sweets, and goes his way,\\n   And lets the hot sun kill them, even go these lovers lay.\\n\\n   And Venus cried, ‘It is dread Artemis\\n      Whose bitter hand hath wrought this cruelty,\\n   Or else that mightier maid whose care it is\\n      To guard her strong and stainless majesty\\n   Upon the hill Athenian,—alas!\\n   That they who loved so well unloved into Death’s house should pass.’\\n\\n   So with soft hands she laid the boy and girl\\n      In the great golden waggon tenderly\\n   (Her white throat whiter than a moony pearl\\n      Just threaded with a blue vein’s tapestry\\n   Had not yet ceased to throb, and still her breast\\n   Swayed like a wind-stirred lily in ambiguous unrest)\\n\\n   And then each pigeon spread its milky van,\\n      The bright car soared into the dawning sky,\\n   And like a cloud the aerial caravan\\n      Passed over the Ægean silently,\\n   Till the faint air was troubled with the song\\n   From the wan mouths that call on bleeding Thammuz all night long.\\n\\n   But when the doves had reached their wonted goal\\n      Where the wide stair of orbèd marble dips\\n   Its snows into the sea, her fluttering soul\\n      Just shook the trembling petals of her lips\\n   And passed into the void, and Venus knew\\n   That one fair maid the less would walk amid her retinue,\\n\\n   And bade her servants carve a cedar chest\\n      With all the wonder of this history,\\n   Within whose scented womb their limbs should rest\\n      Where olive-trees make tender the blue sky\\n   On the low hills of Paphos, and the Faun\\n   Pipes in the noonday, and the nightingale sings on till dawn.\\n\\n   Nor failed they to obey her hest, and ere\\n      The morning bee had stung the daffodil\\n   With tiny fretful spear, or from its lair\\n      The waking stag had leapt across the rill\\n   And roused the ouzel, or the lizard crept\\n   Athwart the sunny rock, beneath the grass their bodies slept.\\n\\n   And when day brake, within that silver shrine\\n      Fed by the flames of cressets tremulous,\\n   Queen Venus knelt and prayed to Proserpine\\n      That she whose beauty made Death amorous\\n   Should beg a guerdon from her pallid Lord,\\n   And let Desire pass across dread Charon’s icy ford.\\n\\n                                     III\\n\\n   IN melancholy moonless Acheron,\\n      Farm for the

thrushes never sing, and piping linnets mate no more,\\n\\n   There by a dim and dark Lethæan well\\n      Young Charmides was lying; wearily\\n   He plucked the blossoms from the asphodel,\\n      And with its little rifled treasury\\n   Strewed the dull waters of the dusky stream,\\n   And watched the white stars founder, and the land was like a dream,\\n\\n   When as he gazed into the watery glass\\n      And through his brown hair’s curly tangles scanned\\n   His own wan face, a shadow seemed to pass\\n      Across the mirror, and a little hand\\n   Stole into his, and warm lips timidly\\n   Brushed his pale cheeks, and breathed their secret forth into a sigh.\\n\\n   Then turned he round his weary eyes and saw,\\n      And ever nigher still their faces came,\\n   And nigher ever did their young mouths draw\\n      Until they seemed one perfect rose of flame,\\n   And longing arms around her neck he cast,\\n   And felt her throbbing bosom, and his breath came hot and fast,\\n\\n   And all his hoarded sweets were hers to kiss,\\n      And all her maidenhood was his to slay,\\n   And limb to limb in long and rapturous bliss\\n      Their passion waxed and waned,—O why essay\\n   To pipe again of love, too venturous reed!\\n   Enough, enough that Eros laughed upon that flowerless mead.\\n\\n   Too venturous poesy, O why essay\\n      To pipe again of passion! fold thy wings\\n   O’er daring Icarus and bid thy lay\\n      Sleep hidden in the lyre’s silent strings\\n   Till thou hast found the old Castalian rill,\\n   Or from the Lesbian waters plucked drowned Sappho’s golden quid!\\n\\n   Enough, enough that he whose life had been\\n      A fiery pulse of sin, a splendid shame,\\n   Could in the loveless land of Hades glean\\n      One scorching harvest from those fields of flame\\n   Where passion walks with naked unshod feet\\n   And is not wounded,—ah! enough that once their lips could meet\\n\\n   In that wild throb when all existences\\n      Seemed narrowed to one single ecstasy\\n   Which dies through its own sweetness and the stress\\n      Of too much pleasure, ere Persephone\\n   Had bade them serve her by the ebon throne\\n   Of

clay\\n   I had climbed the higher heights unclimbed\\n      yet, seen the fuller air, the larger day.\\n\\n   From the wildness of my wasted passion I had\\n      struck a better, clearer song,\\n   Lit some lighter light of freer freedom, battled\\n      with some Hydra-headed wrong.\\n\\n   Had my lips been smitten into music by the\\n      kisses that but made them bleed,\\n   You had walked with Bice and the angels on\\n      that verdant and enamelled mead.\\n\\n   I had trod the road which Dante treading saw\\n      the suns of seven circles shine,\\n   Ay! perchance had seen the heavens opening,\\n      as they opened to the Florentine.\\n\\n   And the mighty nations would have crowned\\n      me, who am crownless now and without name,\\n   And some orient dawn had found me kneeling\\n      on the threshold of the House of Fame.\\n\\n   I had sat within that marble circle where the\\n      oldest bard is as the young,\\n   And the pipe is ever dropping honey, and the\\n      lyre’s strings are ever strung.\\n\\n   Keats had lifted up his hymeneal curls from out\\n      the poppy-seeded wine,\\n   With ambrosial mouth had kissed my forehead,\\n      clasped the hand of noble love in mine.\\n\\n   And at springtide, when the apple-blossoms brush\\n      the burnished bosom of the dove,\\n   Two young lovers lying in an orchard would\\n      have read the story of our love.\\n\\n   Would have read the legend of my passion,\\n      known the bitter secret of my heart,\\n   Kissed as we have kissed, but never parted as\\n      we two are fated now to part.\\n\\n   For the crimson flower of our life is eaten by\\n      the cankerworm of truth,\\n   And no hand can gather up the fallen withered\\n      petals of the rose of youth.\\n\\n   Yet I am not sorry that I loved you—ah! what\\n      else had I a boy to do,—\\n   For the hungry teeth of time devour, and the\\n      silent-footed years pursue.\\n\\n   Rudderless, we drift athwart a tempest, and\\n      when once the storm of youth is past,\\n   Without lyre, without lute or chorus, Death\\n      the silent pilot comes at last.\\n\\n   And within the grave there is no pleasure, for\\n      the blindworm battens on the root,\\n   And Desire shudders into ashes, and the tree of\\n      Passion bears no fruit.\\n\\n   Ah! what else had I to do but love you, God’s\\n      own mother was less dear to me,\\n   And less dear the Cytheræan rising like an\\n      argent lily from the sea.\\n\\n   I have made my choice, have lived my poems,\\n      and, though youth is gone in wasted days,\\n   I have found the lover’s crown of myrtle better\\n      than the poet’s crown of bays.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nUNCOLLECTED POEMS\\n\\n\\nFROM SPRING DAYS TO WINTER\\n\\n\\n                               (FOR

wheeling in the wind.\\n\\n   Like wire-pulled automatons,\\n   Slim silhouetted skeletons\\n   Went sidling through the slow quadrille,\\n\\n   Then took each other by the hand,\\n   And danced a stately saraband;\\n   Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.\\n\\n   Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed\\n   A phantom lover to her breast,\\n   Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.\\n\\n   Sometimes a horrible marionette\\n   Came out, and smoked its cigarette\\n   Upon the steps like a live thing.\\n\\n   Then, turning to my love, I said,\\n   ‘The dead are dancing with the dead,\\n   The dust is whirling with the dust.’\\n\\n   But she—she heard the violin,\\n   And left my side, and entered in:\\n   Love passed into the house of lust.\\n\\n   Then suddenly the tune went false,\\n

filled the ear,\\n      As their grisly masque they led,\\n   And loud they sang, and long they sang,\\n      For they sang to wake the dead.\\n\\n   ‘_Oho_!’ _they cried_, ‘_The world is wide_,\\n      _But fettered limbs go lame_!\\n   _And once_, _or twice_, _to throw the dice_\\n      _Is a gentlemanly game_,\\n   _But he does not win who plays with Sin_\\n      _In the secret House of Shame_.’\\n\\n   No things of air these antics were,\\n      That frolicked with such glee:\\n   To men whose lives were held in gyves,\\n      And whose feet might not go free,\\n   Ah! wounds of Christ! they were living things,\\n      Most terrible to see.\\n\\n   Around, around, they waltzed and wound;\\n      Some wheeled in smirking pairs;\\n   With the mincing step of a demirep\\n      Some sidled up the stairs:\\n   And with subtle sneer, and fawning leer,\\n      Each helped us at our prayers.\\n\\n   The morning wind began to moan,\\n      But still the night went on:\\n   Through its giant loom the web of gloom\\n      Crept till each thread was spun:\\n   And, as we prayed, we grew afraid\\n      Of the Justice of the Sun.\\n\\n   The moaning wind went wandering round\\n      The weeping prison-wall:\\n   Till like a wheel of turning steel\\n      We felt the minutes crawl:\\n   O moaning wind! what had we done\\n      To have such a seneschal?\\n\\n   At last I saw the shadowed bars,\\n      Like a lattice wrought in lead,\\n   Move right across the whitewashed wall\\n      That faced my three-plank bed,\\n   And I knew that somewhere in the world\\n      God’s dreadful dawn was red.\\n\\n   At six o’clock we cleaned our cells,\\n      At seven all was still,\\n   But the sough and swing of a mighty wing\\n      The prison seemed to fill,\\n   For the Lord of Death with icy breath\\n      Had entered in to kill.\\n\\n   He did not pass in purple pomp,\\n      Nor ride a moon-white steed.\\n   Three yards of cord and a sliding board\\n      Are all the gallows’ need:\\n   So with rope of shame the Herald came\\n      To do the secret deed.\\n\\n   We were as men who through a fen\\n      Of filthy darkness grope:\\n   We did not dare to breathe a prayer,\\n      Or to give our anguish scope:\\n   Something was dead in each of us,\\n      And what was dead was Hope.\\n\\n   For Man’s grim Justice goes its way,\\n      And will not swerve aside:\\n   It slays the weak, it slays the strong,\\n      It has a deadly stride:\\n   With iron heel it slays the strong,\\n      The monstrous parricide!\\n\\n   We waited for the stroke of eight:\\n      Each tongue was thick with thirst:\\n   For the stroke of eight is the stroke of Fate\\n      That makes a man accursed,\\n   And Fate will use a running noose\\n      For the best man and the worst.\\n\\n   We had no other thing to do,\\n      Save to wait for the sign to come:\\n   So, like things of stone in a valley lone,\\n      Quiet we sat and dumb:\\n   But each man’s heart beat thick and quick,\\n      Like a madman on a drum!\\n\\n   With sudden shock the prison-clock\\n      Smote on the shivering air,\\n   And from all the gaol rose up a wail\\n      Of impotent despair,\\n   Like the sound that frightened marshes hear\\n      From some leper in his lair.\\n\\n   And as one sees most fearful things\\n      In the crystal of a dream,\\n   We saw the greasy hempen rope\\n      Hooked to the blackened beam,\\n   And heard the prayer the hangman’s snare\\n      Strangled into a scream.\\n\\n   And all the woe that moved him so\\n      That he gave that bitter cry,\\n   And the wild regrets, and the bloody sweats,\\n      None knew so well as I:\\n   For he who lives more lives than one\\n      More deaths than one must die.\\n\\n

O lone Platæan plain!\\n   O tossing waves of wild Euboean sea!\\n   O wind-swept heights of lone Thermopylæ!\\n   He loved you well—ay, not alone in word,\\n   Who freely gave to thee his lyre and sword,\\n   Like Æschylos at well-fought Marathon:\\n\\n      And England, too, shall glory in her son,\\n   Her warrior-poet, first in song and fight.\\n   No longer now shall Slander’s venomed spite\\n   Crawl like a snake across his perfect name,\\n   Or mar the lordly scutcheon of his fame.\\n\\n      For as the olive-garland of the race,\\n   Which lights with joy each eager runner’s face,\\n   As the red cross which saveth men in war,\\n   As a flame-bearded beacon seen from far\\n   By mariners upon a storm-tossed sea,—\\n   Such was his love for Greece and Liberty!\\n\\n      Byron, thy crowns are ever fresh and green:\\n   Red leaves of rose from Sapphic Mitylene\\n   Shall bind thy brows; the myrtle blooms for thee,\\n   In hidden glades by lonely Castaly;\\n   The laurels wait thy coming: all are thine,\\n   And round thy head one perfect wreath will twine.\\n\\n                                     V.\\n\\n      The pine-tops rocked before the evening breeze\\n   With the hoarse murmur of the wintry seas,\\n   And the tall stems were streaked with amber bright;—\\n   I wandered through the wood in wild delight,\\n   Some startled bird, with fluttering wings and fleet,\\n   Made snow of all the blossoms; at my feet,\\n   Like silver crowns, the pale narcissi lay,\\n   And small birds sang on every twining spray.\\n   O waving trees, O forest liberty!\\n   Within your haunts at least a man is free,\\n   And half forgets the weary world of strife:\\n   The blood flows hotter, and a sense of life\\n   Wakes i’ the quickening veins, while once again\\n   The woods are filled with gods we fancied slain.\\n   Long time I watched, and surely hoped to see\\n   Some goat-foot Pan make merry minstrelsy\\n   Amid the reeds! some startled Dryad-maid\\n   In girlish flight! or lurking in the glade,\\n   The soft brown limbs, the wanton treacherous face\\n   Of woodland god! Queen Dian in the chase,\\n   White-limbed and terrible, with look of pride,\\n   And leash of boar-hounds leaping at her side!\\n   Or Hylas mirrored in the perfect stream.\\n\\n      O idle heart!

O sad!  O Queen uncomforted!\\n   In ruined loveliness thou liest dead,\\n   Alone of all thy sisters; for at last\\n   Italia’s royal warrior hath passed\\n   Rome’s lordliest entrance, and hath worn his crown\\n   In the high temples of the Eternal Town!\\n   The Palatine hath welcomed back her king,\\n   And with his name the seven mountains ring!\\n\\n      And Naples hath outlived her dream of pain,\\n   And mocks her tyrant!  Venice lives again,\\n   New risen from the waters! and the cry\\n   Of Light and Truth, of Love and Liberty,\\n   Is heard in lordly Genoa, and where\\n   The marble spires of Milan wound the air,\\n   Rings from the Alps to the Sicilian shore,\\n   And Dante’s dream is now a dream no more.\\n\\n      But thou, Ravenna, better loved than all,\\n   Thy ruined palaces are but a pall\\n   That hides thy fallen greatness! and thy name\\n   Burns like a grey and flickering candle-flame\\n   Beneath the noonday splendour of the sun\\n   Of new Italia! for the night is done,\\n   The night of dark oppression, and the day\\n   Hath dawned in passionate splendour: far away\\n   The Austrian hounds are hunted from the land,\\n   Beyond those ice-crowned citadels which stand\\n   Girdling the plain of royal Lombardy,\\n   From the far West unto the Eastern sea.\\n\\n      I know, indeed, that sons of thine have died\\n   In Lissa’s waters, by the mountain-side\\n   Of Aspromonte, on Novara’s plain,—\\n   Nor have thy children died for thee in vain:\\n   And yet, methinks, thou hast not drunk this wine\\n   From grapes new-crushed of Liberty divine,\\n   Thou hast not followed that immortal Star\\n   Which leads the people forth to deeds of war.\\n   Weary of life, thou liest in silent sleep,\\n   As one who marks the lengthening shadows creep,\\n   Careless of all the hurrying hours that run,\\n   Mourning some day of glory, for the sun\\n   Of Freedom hath not shewn to thee his face,\\n   And thou hast caught no flambeau in the race.\\n\\n      Yet wake not from thy slumbers,—rest thee well,\\n   Amidst thy fields of amber asphodel,\\n   Thy lily-sprinkled meadows,—rest thee there,\\n   To mock all human greatness: who would dare\\n   To vent the paltry sorrows of his life\\n   Before thy ruins, or to praise the strife\\n   Of kings’ ambition, and the barren pride\\n   Of warring nations! wert not thou the Bride\\n   Of the wild Lord of Adria’s stormy sea!\\n   The Queen of double Empires! and to thee\\n   Were not the nations given as thy prey!\\n   And now—thy gates lie open night and day,\\n   The grass grows green on every tower and hall,\\n   The ghastly fig hath cleft thy bastioned wall;\\n   And where thy mailèd warriors stood at rest\\n   The midnight owl hath made her secret nest.\\n   O fallen! fallen! from thy high estate,\\n   O city trammelled in the toils of Fate,\\n   Doth nought remain of all thy glorious days,\\n   But a dull shield, a crown of withered bays!\\n\\n      Yet who beneath this night of wars and fears,\\n   From tranquil tower can watch the coming years;\\n   Who can foretell what joys the day shall bring,\\n   Or why before the dawn the linnets sing?\\n   Thou, even thou, mayst wake, as wakes the rose\\n   To crimson splendour from its grave of snows;\\n   As the rich corn-fields rise to red and gold\\n   From these brown lands, now stiff with Winter’s cold;\\n   As from the storm-rack comes a perfect star!\\n\\n      O much-loved city!  I have wandered far\\n   From the wave-circled islands of my home;\\n   Have seen the gloomy mystery of the Dome\\n   Rise slowly from the drear Campagna’s way,\\n   Clothed in the royal purple of the day:\\n   I from the city of the violet crown\\n   Have watched the sun by Corinth’s hill go down,\\n   And marked the ‘myriad laughter’ of the sea\\n   From starlit hills of flower-starred Arcady;\\n   Yet back to thee returns my perfect love,\\n   As to its forest-nest the evening dove.\\n\\n      O poet’s city! one who scarce has seen\\n   Some twenty summers cast their doublets green\\n   For Autumn’s livery, would seek in vain\\n   To wake his lyre to sing a louder strain,\\n   Or tell thy days of glory;—poor indeed\\n   Is the low murmur of the shepherd’s reed,\\n   Where the loud clarion’s blast should shake the sky,\\n   And flame across the heavens! and to try\\n   Such lofty themes were folly: yet I know\\n   That never felt my heart a nobler glow\\n   Than when I woke the silence of thy street\\n   With clamorous trampling of my horse’s feet,\\n   And saw the city which now I try to sing,\\n   After long days of weary travelling.\\n\\n                                    VII.\\n\\n      Adieu, Ravenna! but a year ago,\\n   I stood and watched the crimson sunset glow\\n   From the lone chapel on thy marshy plain:\\n   The sky was as a shield that caught the stain\\n   Of blood and battle from the dying sun,\\n   And in the west the circling clouds had spun\\n   A royal robe, which some great God might wear,\\n   While into ocean-seas of purple air\\n   Sank the gold galley of the Lord of Light.\\n\\n      Yet here the gentle stillness of the night\\n   Brings back the swelling tide of memory,\\n   And wakes again my passionate love for thee:\\n   Now is the Spring of Love, yet soon will come\\n   On meadow and tree the Summer’s lordly bloom;\\n   And soon the grass with brighter flowers will blow,\\n   And send up lilies for some boy to mow.\\n   Then before long the Summer’s conqueror,\\n   Rich Autumn-time, the season’s usurer,\\n   Will lend his hoarded gold to all the trees,\\n   And see it scattered by the spendthrift breeze;\\n   And after that the Winter cold and drear.\\n   So runs the perfect cycle of the year.\\n   And so from youth to manhood do we go,\\n   And fall to weary days and locks of snow.\\n   Love only knows no winter; never dies:\\n   Nor cares for frowning storms or leaden skies\\n   And mine for thee shall never pass away,\\n   Though my weak lips may falter in my lay.\\n\\n      Adieu!  Adieu! yon silent evening star,\\n   The night’s ambassador, doth gleam afar,\\n   And bid the shepherd bring his flocks to fold.\\n   Perchance before our inland seas of gold\\n   Are garnered by the reapers into sheaves,\\n   Perchance before I see the Autumn leaves,\\n   I may behold thy city; and lay down\\n   Low at thy feet the poet’s laurel crown.\\n\\n      Adieu!

In 2001, the Project\\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\\n\\n\\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S.

For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.

It belongs to Wilde’s Oxford days\\nwhen he was the unsuccessful competitor for the Chancellor’s English\\nEssay Prize.  Perhaps Magdalen, which has never forgiven herself for\\nnurturing the author of _Ravenna_, may be felicitated on having escaped\\nthe further intolerable honour that she might have suffered by seeing\\ncrowned again with paltry academic parsley the most highly gifted of all\\nher children in the last century.\\n\\nOf the lectures, I have only included those which exist, so far as I\\nknow, in manuscript; the reports of others in contemporary newspapers\\nbeing untrustworthy.  They were usually delivered from notes and were\\nrepeated at various towns in England and America.  Here will be found the\\norigin of Whistler’s charges of plagiarism against the author.  How far\\nthey are justified the reader can decide for himself, Wilde always\\nadmitted that, relying on an old and intimate friendship, he asked the\\nartist’s assistance on one occasion for a lecture he had failed to\\nprepare in time.  This I presume to be the Address delivered to the Art\\nStudents of the Royal Academy in 1883, as Whistler certainly reproduced\\nsome of it as his own in the ‘Ten o’clock’ lecture delivered\\nsubsequently, in 1885.  To what extent an idea may be regarded as a\\nperpetual gift, or whether it is ethically possible to retrieve an idea\\nlike an engagement ring, it is not for me to discuss.  I would only point\\nout once more that all the works by which Wilde is known throughout\\nEurope were written after the two friends had quarrelled.  That Wilde\\nderived a great deal from the older man goes without saying, just as he\\nderived so much in a greater degree from Pater, Ruskin, Arnold and\\nBurne-Jones.  Yet the tedious attempt to recognise in every jest of his\\nsome original by Whistler induces the criticism that it seems a pity the\\ngreat painter did not get them off on the public before he was\\nforestalled.  Reluctance from an appeal to publicity was never a weakness\\nin either of the men.  Some of Wilde’s more frequently quoted sayings\\nwere made at the Old Bailey (though their provenance is often forgotten)\\nor on his death-bed.\\n\\nAs a matter of fact the genius of the two men was entirely different.\\nWilde was a humourist and a humanist before everything; and his wittiest\\njests have neither the relentlessness nor the keenness characterising\\nthose of the clever American artist.  Again, Whistler could no more have\\nobtained the Berkeley Gold Medal for Greek, nor have written _The\\nImportance of Being Earnest_, and _The Soul of Man_, than Wilde, even if\\nequipped as a painter, could have evinced that superb restraint\\ncharacterising the portraits of ‘Miss Alexander,’ ‘Carlyle,’ and other\\nmasterpieces.  Wilde, though it is not generally known, was something of\\na draughtsman in his youth.\\n\\n_Poems in Prose_ were to have been continued.  They are the kind of\\nstories which Wilde would tell at a dinner-table, being invented on the\\nspur of the moment, or inspired by the chance observation of some one who\\nmanaged to get the traditional word in edgeways; or they were developed\\nfrom some phrase in a book Wilde might have read during the day.  To\\nthose who remember hearing them from his lips there must always be a\\nfeeling of disappointment on reading them.  He overloaded their ornament\\nwhen he came to transcribe them, and some of his friends did not hesitate\\nto make that criticism to him personally.  Though he affected annoyance,\\nI do not think it prevented him from writing the others, which\\nunfortunately exist only in the memories of friends.  Miss Aimée Lowther,\\nhowever, has cleverly noted down some of them in a privately printed\\nvolume.\\n\\n                                                               ROBERT ROSS\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE RISE OF HISTORICAL CRITICISM\\n\\n\\nThis Essay was written for the Chancellor’s English Essay Prize at Oxford\\nin 1879, the subject being ‘Historical Criticism among the Ancients.’\\nThe prize was not awarded.  To Professor J. W. Mackail thanks are due for\\nrevising the proofs.\\n\\n\\n\\nI\\n\\n\\nHISTORICAL criticism nowhere occurs as an isolated fact in the\\ncivilisation or literature of any people.  It is part of that complex\\nworking towards freedom which may be described as the revolt against\\nauthority.  It is merely one facet of that speculative spirit of an\\ninnovation, which in the sphere of action produces democracy and\\nrevolution, and in that of thought is the parent of philosophy and\\nphysical science; and its importance as a factor of progress is based not\\nso much on the results it attains, as on the tone of thought which it\\nrepresents, and the method by which it works.\\n\\nBeing thus the resultant of forces essentially revolutionary, it is not\\nto be found in the ancient world among the material despotisms of Asia or\\nthe stationary civilisation of Egypt.  The clay cylinders of Assyria and\\nBabylon, the hieroglyphics of the pyramids, form not history but the\\nmaterial for history.\\n\\nThe Chinese annals, ascending as they do to the barbarous forest life of\\nthe nation, are marked with a soberness of judgment, a freedom from\\ninvention, which is almost unparalleled in the writings of any people;\\nbut the protective spirit which is the characteristic of that people\\nproved as fatal to their literature as to their commerce.  Free criticism\\nis as unknown as free trade.  While as regards the Hindus, their acute,\\nanalytical and logical mind is directed rather to grammar, criticism and\\nphilosophy than to history or chronology.  Indeed, in history their\\nimagination seems to have run wild, legend and fact are so indissolubly\\nmingled together that any attempt to separate them seems vain.  If we\\nexcept the identification of the Greek Sandracottus with the Indian\\nChandragupta, we have really no clue by which we can test the truth of\\ntheir writings or examine their method of investigation.\\n\\nIt is among the Hellenic branch of the Indo-Germanic race that history\\nproper is to be found, as well as the spirit of historical criticism;\\namong that wonderful offshoot of the primitive Aryans, whom we call by\\nthe name of Greeks and to whom, as has been well said, we owe all that\\nmoves in the world except the blind forces of nature.\\n\\nFor, from the day when they left the chill table-lands of Tibet and\\njourneyed, a nomad people, to Ægean shores, the characteristic of their\\nnature has been the search for light, and the spirit of historical\\ncriticism is part of that wonderful Aufklärung or illumination of the\\nintellect which seems to have burst on the Greek race like a great flood\\nof light about the sixth century B.C.\\n\\n_L’esprit d’un siècle ne naît pas et ne meurt pas à jour fixe_, and the\\nfirst critic is perhaps as difficult to discover as the first man.  It is\\nfrom democracy that the spirit of criticism borrows its intolerance of\\ndogmatic authority, from physical science the alluring analogies of law\\nand order, from philosophy the conception of an essential unity\\nunderlying the complex manifestations of phenomena.  It appears first\\nrather as a changed attitude of mind than as a principle of research, and\\nits earliest influences are to be found in the sacred writings.\\n\\nFor men begin to doubt in questions of religion first, and then in\\nmatters of more secular interest; and as regards the nature of the spirit\\nof historical criticism itself in its ultimate development, it is not\\nconfined merely to the empirical method of ascertaining whether an event\\nhappened or not, but is concerned also with the investigation into the\\ncauses of events, the general relations which phenomena of life hold to\\none another, and in its ultimate development passes into the wider\\nquestion of the philosophy of history.\\n\\nNow, while the workings of historical criticism in these two spheres of\\nsacred and uninspired history are essentially manifestations of the same\\nspirit, yet their methods are so different, the canons of evidence so\\nentirely separate, and the motives in each case so unconnected, that it\\nwill be necessary for a clear estimation of the progress of Greek\\nthought, that we should consider these two questions entirely apart from\\none another.  I shall then in both cases take the succession of writers\\nin their chronological order as representing the rational order—not that\\nthe succession of time is always the succession of ideas, or that\\ndialectics moves ever in the straight line in which Hegel conceives its\\nadvance.  In Greek thought, as elsewhere, there are periods of stagnation\\nand apparent retrogression, yet their intellectual development, not\\nmerely in the question of historical criticism, but in their art, their\\npoetry and their philosophy, seems so essentially normal, so free from\\nall disturbing external influences, so peculiarly rational, that in\\nfollowing in the footsteps of time we shall really be progressing in the\\norder sanctioned by reason.\\n\\n\\n\\nII\\n\\n\\nAT an early period in their intellectual development the Greeks reached\\nthat critical point in the history of every civilised nation, when\\nspeculative invades the domain of revealed truth, when the spiritual\\nideas of the people can no longer be satisfied by the lower, material\\nconceptions of their inspired writers, and when men find it impossible to\\npour the new wine of free thought into the old bottles of a narrow and a\\ntrammelling creed.\\n\\nFrom their Aryan ancestors they had received the fatal legacy of a\\nmythology stained with immoral and monstrous stories which strove to hide\\nthe rational order of nature in a chaos of miracles, and to mar by\\nimputed wickedness the perfection of God’s nature—a very shirt of Nessos\\nin which the Heracles of rationalism barely escaped annihilation.  Now\\nwhile undoubtedly the speculations of Thales, and the alluring analogies\\nof law and order afforded by physical science, were most important forces\\nin encouraging the rise of the spirit of scepticism, yet it was on its\\nethical side that the Greek mythology was chiefly open to attack.\\n\\nIt is difficult to shake the popular belief in miracles, but no man will\\nadmit sin and immorality as attributes of the Ideal he worships; so the\\nfirst symptoms of a new order of thought are shown in the passionate\\noutcries of Xenophanes and Heraclitos against the evil things said by\\nHomer of the sons of God; and in the story told of Pythagoras, how that\\nhe saw tortured in Hell the ‘two founders of Greek theology,’ we can\\nrecognise the rise of the Aufklärung as clearly as we see the Reformation\\nforeshadowed in the _Inferno_ of Dante.\\n\\nAny honest belief, then, in the plain truth of these stories soon\\nsuccumbed before the destructive effects of the _a priori_ ethical\\ncriticism of this school; but the orthodox party, as is its custom, found\\nimmediately a convenient shelter under the ægis of the doctrine of\\nmetaphors and concealed meanings.\\n\\nTo this allegorical school the tale of the fight around the walls of Troy\\nwas a mystery, behind which, as behind a veil, were hidden certain moral\\nand physical truths.  The contest between Athena and Ares was that\\neternal contest between rational thought and the brute force of\\nignorance; the arrows which rattled in the quiver of the ‘Far Darter’\\nwere no longer the instruments of vengeance shot from the golden bow of\\nthe child of God, but the common rays of the sun, which was itself\\nnothing but a mere inert mass of burning metal.\\n\\nModern investigation, with the ruthlessness of Philistine analysis, has\\nultimately brought Helen of Troy down to a symbol of the dawn.  There\\nwere Philistines among the Greeks also who saw in the _ἄναξ ἀδρῶν_ a mere\\nmetaphor for atmospheric power.\\n\\nNow while this tendency to look for metaphors and hidden meanings must be\\nranked as one of the germs of historical criticism, yet it was\\nessentially unscientific.  Its inherent weakness is clearly pointed out\\nby Plato, who showed that while this theory will no doubt explain many of\\nthe current legends, yet, if it is to be appealed to at all, it must be\\nas a universal principle; a position he is by no means prepared to admit.\\n\\nLike many other great principles it suffered from its disciples, and\\nfurnished its own refutation when the web of Penelope was analysed into a\\nmetaphor of the rules of formal logic, the warp representing the\\npremises, and the woof the conclusion.\\n\\nRejecting, then, the allegorical interpretation of the sacred writings as\\nan essentially dangerous method, proving either too much or too little,\\nPlato himself returns to the earlier mode of attack, and re-writes\\nhistory with a didactic purpose, laying down certain ethical canons of\\nhistorical criticism.  God is good; God is just; God is true; God is\\nwithout the common passions of men.  These are the tests to which we are\\nto bring the stories of the Greek religion.\\n\\n‘God predestines no men to ruin, nor sends destruction on innocent\\ncities; He never walks the earth in strange disguise, nor has to mourn\\nfor the death of any well-beloved son.  Away with the tears for Sarpedon,\\nthe lying dream sent to Agamemnon, and the story of the broken covenant!’\\n(Plato, _Republic_, Book ii. 380; iii. 388, 391.)\\n\\nSimilar ethical canons are applied to the accounts of the heroes of the\\ndays of old, and by the same _a priori_ principles Achilles is rescued\\nfrom the charges of avarice and insolence in a passage which may be\\nrecited as the earliest instance of that ‘whitewashing of great men,’ as\\nit has been called, which is so popular in our own day, when Catiline and\\nClodius are represented as honest and far-seeing politicians, when _eine\\nedle und gute Natur_ is claimed for Tiberius, and Nero is rescued from\\nhis heritage of infamy as an accomplished _dilettante_ whose moral\\naberrations are more than excused by his exquisite artistic sense and\\ncharming tenor voice.\\n\\nBut besides the allegorising principle of interpretation, and the ethical\\nreconstruction of history, there was a third theory, which may be called\\nthe semi-historical, and which goes by the name of Euhemeros, though he\\nwas by no means the first to propound it.\\n\\nAppealing to a fictitious monument which he declared that he had\\ndiscovered in the island of Panchaia, and which purported to be a column\\nerected by Zeus, and detailing the incidents of his reign on earth, this\\nshallow thinker attempted to show that the gods and heroes of ancient\\nGreece were ‘mere ordinary mortals, whose achievements had been a good\\ndeal exaggerated and misrepresented,’ and that the proper canon of\\nhistorical criticism as regards the treatment of myths was to rationalise\\nthe incredible, and to present the plausible residuum as actual truth.\\n\\nTo him and his school, the centaurs, for instance, those mythical sons of\\nthe storm, strange links between the lives of men and animals, were\\nmerely some youths from the village of Nephele in Thessaly, distinguished\\nfor their sporting tastes; the ‘living harvest of panoplied knights,’\\nwhich sprang so mystically from the dragon’s teeth, a body of mercenary\\ntroops supported by the profits on a successful speculation in ivory; and\\nActæon, an ordinary master of hounds, who, living before the days of\\nsubscription, was eaten out of house and home by the expenses of his\\nkennel.\\n\\nNow, that under the glamour of myth and legend some substratum of\\nhistorical fact may lie, is a proposition rendered extremely probable by\\nthe modern investigations into the workings of the mythopœic spirit in\\npost-Christian times.  Charlemagne and Roland, St. Francis and William\\nTell, are none the less real personages because their histories are\\nfilled with much that is fictitious and incredible, but in all cases what\\nis essentially necessary is some external corroboration, such as is\\nafforded by the mention of Roland and Roncesvalles in the chronicles of\\nEngland, or (in the sphere of Greek legend) by the excavations of\\nHissarlik.  But to rob a mythical narrative of its kernel of supernatural\\nelements, and to present the dry husk thus obtained as historical fact,\\nis, as has been well said, to mistake entirely the true method of\\ninvestigation and to identify plausibility with truth.\\n\\nAnd as regards the critical point urged by Palaiphatos, Strabo, and\\nPolybius, that pure invention on Homer’s part is inconceivable, we may\\nwithout scruple allow it, for myths, like constitutions, grow gradually,\\nand are not formed in a day.  But between a poet’s deliberate creation\\nand historical accuracy there is a wide field of the mythopœic faculty.\\n\\nThis Euhemeristic theory was welcomed as an essentially philosophical and\\ncritical method by the unscientific Romans, to whom it was introduced by\\nthe poet Ennius, that pioneer of cosmopolitan Hellenicism, and it\\ncontinued to characterise the tone of ancient thought on the question of\\nthe treatment of mythology till the rise of Christianity, when it was\\nturned by such writers as Augustine and Minucius Felix into a formidable\\nweapon of attack on Paganism.  It was then abandoned by all those who\\nstill bent the knee to Athena or to Zeus, and a general return, aided by\\nthe philosophic mystics of Alexandria, to the allegorising principle of\\ninterpretation took place, as the only means of saving the deities of\\nOlympus from the Titan assaults of the new Galilean God.  In what vain\\ndefence, the statue of Mary set in the heart of the Pantheon can best\\ntell us.\\n\\nReligions, however, may be absorbed, but they never are disproved, and\\nthe stories of the Greek mythology, spiritualised by the purifying\\ninfluence of Christianity, reappear in many of the southern parts of\\nEurope in our own day.  The old fable that the Greek gods took service\\nwith the new religion under assumed names has more truth in it than the\\nmany care to discover.\\n\\nHaving now traced the progress of historical criticism in the special\\ntreatment of myth and legend, I shall proceed to investigate the form in\\nwhich the same spirit manifested itself as regards what one may term\\nsecular history and secular historians.  The field traversed will be\\nfound to be in some respects the same, but the mental attitude, the\\nspirit, the motive of investigation are all changed.\\n\\nThere were heroes before the son of Atreus and historians before\\nHerodotus, yet the latter is rightly hailed as the father of history, for\\nin him we discover not merely the empirical connection of cause and\\neffect, but that constant reference to Laws, which is the characteristic\\nof the historian proper.\\n\\nFor all history must be essentially universal; not in the sense of\\ncomprising all the synchronous events of the past time, but through the\\nuniversality of the principles employed.  And the great conceptions which\\nunify the work of Herodotus are such as even modern thought has not yet\\nrejected.  The immediate government of the world by God, the nemesis and\\npunishment which sin and pride invariably bring with them, the revealing\\nof God’s purpose to His people by signs and omens, by miracles and by\\nprophecy; these are to Herodotus the laws which govern the phenomena of\\nhistory.  He is essentially the type of supernatural historian; his eyes\\nare ever strained to discern the Spirit of God moving over the face of\\nthe waters of life; he is more concerned with final than with efficient\\ncauses.\\n\\nYet we can discern in him the rise of that _historic sense_ which is the\\nrational antecedent of the science of historical criticism, the _φυσικὸν\\nκριτήριον_, to use the words of a Greek writer, as opposed to that which\\ncomes either _τέχνη_ or _διδαχῇ_.\\n\\nHe has passed through the valley of faith and has caught a glimpse of the\\nsunlit heights of Reason; but like all those who, while accepting the\\nsupernatural, yet attempt to apply the canons of rationalism, he is\\nessentially inconsistent.  For the better apprehension of the character\\nof this historic sense in Herodotus it will be necessary to examine at\\nsome length the various forms of criticism in which it manifests itself.\\n\\nSuch fabulous stories as that of the Phoenix, of the goat-footed men, of\\nthe headless beings with eyes in their breasts, of the men who slept six\\nmonths in the year (_τοῦτο οὐκ ἐνδέχομαι ηὴν ἀρχήν_), of the wer-wolf of\\nthe Neuri, and the like, are entirely rejected by him as being opposed to\\nthe ordinary experience of life, and to those natural laws whose\\nuniversal influence the early Greek physical philosophers had already\\nmade known to the world of thought.  Other legends, such as the suckling\\nof Cyrus by a bitch, or the feather-rain of northern Europe, are\\nrationalised and explained into a woman’s name and a fall of snow.  The\\nsupernatural origin of the Scythian nation, from the union of Hercules\\nand the monstrous Echidna, is set aside by him for the more probable\\naccount that they were a nomad tribe driven by the Massagetæ from Asia;\\nand he appeals to the local names of their country as proof of the fact\\nthat the Kimmerians were the original possessors.\\n\\nBut in the case of Herodotus it will be more instructive to pass on from\\npoints like these to those questions of general probability, the true\\napprehension of which depends rather on a certain quality of mind than on\\nany possibility of formulated rules, questions which form no unimportant\\npart of scientific history; for it must be remembered always that the\\ncanons of historical criticism are essentially different from those of\\njudicial evidence, for they cannot, like the latter, be made plain to\\nevery ordinary mind, but appeal to a certain historical faculty founded\\non the experience of life.  Besides, the rules for the reception of\\nevidence in courts of law are purely stationary, while the science of\\nhistorical probability is essentially progressive, and changes with the\\nadvancing spirit of each age.\\n\\nNow, of all the speculative canons of historical criticism, none is more\\nimportant than that which rests on psychological probability.\\n\\nArguing from his knowledge of human nature, Herodotus rejects the\\npresence of Helen within the walls of Troy.  Had she been there, he says,\\nPriam and his kinsmen would never have been so mad (_φρενοβλαβεῖς_) as\\nnot to give her up, when they and their children and their city were in\\nsuch peril (ii. 118); and as regards the authority of Homer, some\\nincidental passages in his poem show that he knew of Helen’s sojourn in\\nEgypt during the siege, but selected the other story as being a more\\nsuitable motive for an epic.  Similarly he does not believe that the\\nAlcmæonidæ family, a family who had always been the haters of tyranny\\n(_μισοτύραννοι_), and to whom, even more than to Harmodios and\\nAristogeiton, Athens owed its liberty, would ever have been so\\ntreacherous as to hold up a shield after the battle of Marathon as a\\nsignal for the Persian host to fall on the city.  A shield, he\\nacknowledges, was held up, but it could not possibly have been done by\\nsuch friends of liberty as the house of Alcmæon; nor will he believe that\\na great king like Rhampsinitus would have sent his daughter _κατίσαι ἐπ’\\nοἰκήματος_.\\n\\nElsewhere he argues from more general considerations of probability; a\\nGreek courtesan like Rhodopis would hardly have been rich enough to build\\na pyramid, and, besides, on chronological grounds the story is impossible\\n(ii. 134).\\n\\nIn another passage (ii. 63), after giving an account of the forcible\\nentry of the priests of Ares into the chapel of the god’s mother, which\\nseems to have been a sort of religious faction fight where sticks were\\nfreely used (_μάχη ξύλοισι καρτερή_), ‘I feel sure,’ he says, ‘that many\\nof them died from getting their heads broken, notwithstanding the\\nassertions of the Egyptian priests to the contrary.’  There is also\\nsomething charmingly naïve in the account he gives of the celebrated\\nGreek swimmer who dived a distance of eighty stadia to give his\\ncountrymen warning of the Persian advance.  ‘If, however,’ he says, ‘I\\nmay offer an opinion on the subject, I would say that he came in a boat.’\\n\\nThere is, of course, something a little trivial in some of the instances\\nI have quoted; but in a writer like Herodotus, who stands on the\\nborderland between faith and rationalism, one likes to note even the most\\nminute instances of the rise of the critical and sceptical spirit of\\ninquiry.\\n\\nHow really strange, at base, it was with him may, I think, be shown by a\\nreference to those passages where he applies rationalistic tests to\\nmatters connected with religion.  He nowhere, indeed, grapples with the\\nmoral and scientific difficulties of the Greek Bible; and where he\\nrejects as incredible the marvellous achievements of Hercules in Egypt,\\nhe does so on the express grounds that he had not yet been received among\\nthe gods, and so was still subject to the ordinary conditions of mortal\\nlife (_ἔτι ἄνθρωπον ἐόντα_).\\n\\nEven within these limits, however, his religious conscience seems to have\\nbeen troubled at such daring rationalism, and the passage (ii. 45)\\nconcludes with a pious hope that God will pardon him for having gone so\\nfar, the great rationalistic passage being, of course, that in which he\\nrejects the mythical account of the foundation of Dodona.  ‘How can a\\ndove speak with a human voice?’ he asks, and rationalises the bird into a\\nforeign princess.\\n\\nSimilarly he seems more inclined to believe that the great storm at the\\nbeginning of the Persian War ceased from ordinary atmospheric causes, and\\nnot in consequence of the incantations of the _Magians_.  He calls\\nMelampos, whom the majority of the Greeks looked on as an inspired\\nprophet, ‘a clever man who had acquired for himself the art of prophecy’;\\nand as regards the miracle told of the Æginetan statues of the primeval\\ndeities of Damia and Auxesia, that they fell on their knees when the\\nsacrilegious Athenians strove to carry them off, ‘any one may believe\\nit,’ he says, ‘who likes, but as for myself, I place no credence in the\\ntale.’\\n\\nSo much then for the rationalistic spirit of historical criticism, as far\\nas it appears explicitly in the works of this great and philosophic\\nwriter; but for an adequate appreciation of his position we must also\\nnote how conscious he was of the value of documentary evidence, of the\\nuse of inscriptions, of the importance of the poets as throwing light on\\nmanners and customs as well as on historical incidents.  No writer of any\\nage has more vividly recognised the fact that history is a matter of\\nevidence, and that it is as necessary for the historian to state his\\nauthority as it is to produce one’s witnesses in a court of law.\\n\\nWhile, however, we can discern in Herodotus the rise of an historic\\nsense, we must not blind ourselves to the large amount of instances where\\nhe receives supernatural influences as part of the ordinary forces of\\nlife.  Compared to Thucydides, who succeeded him in the development of\\nhistory, he appears almost like a mediæval writer matched with a modern\\nrationalist.  For, contemporary though they were, between these two\\nauthors there is an infinite chasm of thought.\\n\\nThe essential difference of their methods may be best illustrated from\\nthose passages where they treat of the same subject.  The execution of\\nthe Spartan heralds, Nicolaos and Aneristos, during the Peloponnesian War\\nis regarded by Herodotus as one of the most supernatural instances of the\\nworkings of nemesis and the wrath of an outraged hero; while the\\nlengthened siege and ultimate fall of Troy was brought about by the\\navenging hand of God desiring to manifest unto men the mighty penalties\\nwhich always follow upon mighty sins.  But Thucydides either sees not, or\\ndesires not to see, in either of these events the finger of Providence,\\nor the punishment of wicked doers.  The death of the heralds is merely an\\nAthenian retaliation for similar outrages committed by the opposite side;\\nthe long agony of the ten years’ siege is due merely to the want of a\\ngood commissariat in the Greek army; while the fall of the city is the\\nresult of a united military attack consequent on a good supply of\\nprovisions.\\n\\nNow, it is to be observed that in this latter passage, as well as\\nelsewhere, Thucydides is in no sense of the word a sceptic as regards his\\nattitude towards the truth of these ancient legends.\\n\\nAgamemnon and Atreus, Theseus and Eurystheus, even Minos, about whom\\nHerodotus has some doubts, are to him as real personages as Alcibiades or\\nGylippus.  The points in his historical criticism of the past are, first,\\nhis rejection of all extra-natural interference, and, secondly, the\\nattributing to these ancient heroes the motives and modes of thought of\\nhis own day.  The present was to him the key to the explanation of the\\npast, as it was to the prediction of the future.\\n\\nNow, as regards his attitude towards the supernatural he is at one with\\nmodern science.  We too know that, just as the primeval coal-beds reveal\\nto us the traces of rain-drops and other atmospheric phenomena similar to\\nthose of our own day, so, in estimating the history of the past, the\\nintroduction of no force must be allowed whose workings we cannot observe\\namong the phenomena around us.  To lay down canons of ultra-historical\\ncredibility for the explanation of events which happen to have preceded\\nus by a few thousand years, is as thoroughly unscientific as it is to\\nintermingle preternatural in geological theories.\\n\\nWhatever the canons of art may be, no difficulty in history is so great\\nas to warrant the introduction of a spirit of spirit _θεὸς ἀπὸ μηχανῆς_,\\nin the sense of a violation of the laws of nature.\\n\\nUpon the other point, however, Thucydides falls into an anachronism.  To\\nrefuse to allow the workings of chivalrous and self-denying motives among\\nthe knights of the Trojan crusade, because he saw none in the\\nfaction-loving Athenian of his own day, is to show an entire ignorance of\\nthe various characteristics of human nature developing under different\\ncircumstances, and to deny to a primitive chieftain like Agamemnon that\\nauthority founded on opinion, to which we give the name of divine right,\\nis to fall into an historical error quite as gross as attributing to\\nAtreus the courting of the populace (_τεθεραπευκότα τὸν δῆμον_) with a\\nview to the Mycenean throne.\\n\\nThe general method of historical criticism pursued by Thucydides having\\nbeen thus indicated, it remains to proceed more into detail as regards\\nthose particular points where he claims for himself a more rational\\nmethod of estimating evidence than either the public or his predecessors\\npossessed.\\n\\n‘So little pains,’ he remarks, ‘do the vulgar take in the investigation\\nof truth, satisfied with their preconceived opinions,’ that the majority\\nof the Greeks believe in a Pitanate cohort of the Spartan army and in a\\ndouble vote being the prerogative of the Spartan kings, neither of which\\nopinions has any foundation in fact.  But the chief point on which he\\nlays stress as evincing the ‘uncritical way with which men receive\\nlegends, even the legends of their own country,’ is the entire\\nbaselessness of the common Athenian tradition in which Harmodios and\\nAristogeiton were represented as the patriotic liberators of Athens from\\nthe Peisistratid tyranny.  So far, he points out, from the love of\\nfreedom being their motive, both of them were influenced by merely\\npersonal considerations, Aristogeiton being jealous of Hipparchos’\\nattention to Harmodios, then a beautiful boy in the flower of Greek\\nloveliness, while the latter’s indignation was aroused by an insult\\noffered to his sister by the prince.\\n\\nTheir motives, then, were personal revenge, while the result of their\\nconspiracy served only to rivet more tightly the chains of servitude\\nwhich bound Athens to the Peisistratid house, for Hipparchos, whom they\\nkilled, was only the tyrant’s younger brother, and not the tyrant\\nhimself.\\n\\nTo prove his theory that Hippias was the elder, he appeals to the\\nevidence afforded by a public inscription in which his name occurs\\nimmediately after that of his father, a point which he thinks shows that\\nhe was the eldest, and so the heir.  This view he further corroborates by\\nanother inscription, on the altar of Apollo, which mentions the children\\nof Hippias and not those of his brothers; ‘for it was natural for the\\neldest to be married first’; and besides this, on the score of general\\nprobability he points out that, had Hippias been the younger, he would\\nnot have so easily obtained the tyranny on the death of Hipparchos.\\n\\nNow, what is important in Thucydides, as evinced in the treatment of\\nlegend generally, is not the results he arrived at, but the method by\\nwhich he works.  The first great rationalistic historian, he may be said\\nto have paved the way for all those who followed after him, though it\\nmust always be remembered that, while the total absence in his pages of\\nall the mystical paraphernalia of the supernatural theory of life is an\\nadvance in the progress of rationalism, and an era in scientific history,\\nwhose importance could never be over-estimated, yet we find along with it\\na total absence of any mention of those various social and economical\\nforces which form such important factors in the evolution of the world,\\nand to which Herodotus rightly gave great prominence in his immortal\\nwork.  The history of Thucydides is essentially one-sided and incomplete.\\nThe intricate details of sieges and battles, subjects with which the\\nhistorian proper has really nothing to do except so far as they may throw\\nlight on the spirit of the age, we would readily exchange for some notice\\nof the condition of private society in Athens, or the influence and\\nposition of women.\\n\\nThere is an advance in the method of historical criticism; there is an\\nadvance in the conception and motive of history itself; for in Thucydides\\nwe may discern that natural reaction against the intrusion of didactic\\nand theological considerations into the sphere of the pure intellect, the\\nspirit of which may be found in the Euripidean treatment of tragedy and\\nthe later schools of art, as well as in the Platonic conception of\\nscience.\\n\\nHistory, no doubt, has splendid lessons for our instruction, just as all\\ngood art comes to us as the herald of the noblest truth.  But, to set\\nbefore either the painter or the historian the inculcation of moral\\nlessons as an aim to be consciously pursued, is to miss entirely the true\\nmotive and characteristic both of art and history, which is in the one\\ncase the creation of beauty, in the other the discovery of the laws of\\nthe evolution of progress: _Il ne faut demander de l’Art que l’Art_, _du\\npassé que le passé_.\\n\\nHerodotus wrote to illustrate the wonderful ways of Providence and the\\nnemesis that falls on sin, and his work is a good example of the truth\\nthat nothing can dispense with criticism so much as a moral aim.\\nThucydides has no creed to preach, no doctrine to prove.  He analyses the\\nresults which follow inevitably from certain antecedents, in order that\\non a recurrence of the same crisis men may know how to act.\\n\\nHis object was to discover the laws of the past so as to serve as a light\\nto illumine the future.  We must not confuse the recognition of the\\nutility of history with any ideas of a didactic aim.  Two points more in\\nThucydides remain for our consideration: his treatment of the rise of\\nGreek civilisation, and of the primitive condition of Hellas, as well as\\nthe question how far can he be said really to have recognised the\\nexistence of laws regulating the complex phenomena of life.\\n\\n\\n\\nIII\\n\\n\\nTHE investigation into the two great problems of the origin of society\\nand the philosophy of history occupies such an important position in the\\nevolution of Greek thought that, to obtain any clear view of the workings\\nof the critical spirit, it will be necessary to trace at some length\\ntheir rise and scientific development as evinced not merely in the works\\nof historians proper, but also in the philosophical treatises of Plato\\nand Aristotle.  The important position which these two great thinkers\\noccupy in the progress of historical criticism can hardly be\\nover-estimated.  I do not mean merely as regards their treatment of the\\nGreek Bible, and Plato’s endeavours to purge sacred history of its\\nimmorality by the application of ethical canons at the time when\\nAristotle was beginning to undermine the basis of miracles by his\\nscientific conception of law, but with reference to these two wider\\nquestions of the rise of civil institutions and the philosophy of\\nhistory.\\n\\nAnd first, as regards the current theories of the primitive condition of\\nsociety, there was a wide divergence of opinion in Hellenic society, just\\nas there is now.  For while the majority of the orthodox public, of whom\\nHesiod may be taken as the representative, looked back, as a great many\\nof our own day still do, to a fabulous age of innocent happiness, a\\n_bell’ età dell’ auro_, where sin and death were unknown and men and\\nwomen were like Gods, the foremost men of intellect such as Aristotle and\\nPlato, Æschylus and many of the other poets {29} saw in primitive man ‘a\\nfew small sparks of humanity preserved on the tops of mountains after\\nsome deluge,’ ‘without an idea of cities, governments or legislation,’\\n‘living the lives of wild beasts in sunless caves,’ ‘their only law being\\nthe survival of the fittest.’\\n\\nAnd this, too, was the opinion of Thucydides, whose _Archæologia_ as it\\nis contains a most valuable disquisition on the early condition of\\nHellas, which it will be necessary to examine at some length.\\n\\nNow, as regards the means employed generally by Thucydides for the\\nelucidation of ancient history, I have already pointed out how that,\\nwhile acknowledging that ‘it is the tendency of every poet to exaggerate,\\nas it is of every chronicler to seek to be attractive at the expense of\\ntruth,’ he yet assumes in the thoroughly euhemeristic way, that under the\\nveil of myth and legend there does yet exist a rational basis of fact\\ndiscoverable by the method of rejecting all supernatural interference as\\nwell as any extraordinary motives influencing the actors.  It is in\\ncomplete accordance with this spirit that he appeals, for instance, to\\nthe Homeric epithet of _ἀφνειός_, as applied to Corinth, as a proof of\\nthe early commercial prosperity of that city; to the fact of the generic\\nname _Hellenes_ not occurring in the _Iliad_ as a corroboration of his\\ntheory of the essentially disunited character of the primitive Greek\\ntribes; and he argues from the line ‘O’er many islands and all Argos\\nruled,’ as applied to Agamemnon, that his forces must have been partially\\nnaval, ‘for Agamemnon’s was a continental power, and he could not have\\nbeen master of any but the adjacent islands, and these would not be many\\nbut through the possession of a fleet.’\\n\\nAnticipating in some measure the comparative method of research, he\\nargues from the fact of the more barbarous Greek tribes, such as the\\nÆtolians and Acarnanians, still carrying arms in his own day, that this\\ncustom was the case originally over the whole country.  ‘The fact,’ he\\nsays, ‘that the people in these parts of Hellas are still living in the\\nold way points to a time when the same mode of life was equally common to\\nall.’  Similarly, in another passage, he shows how a corroboration of his\\ntheory of the respectable character of piracy in ancient days is afforded\\nby ‘the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the continent still\\nregard a successful marauder,’ as well as by the fact that the question,\\n‘Are you a pirate?’ is a common feature of primitive society as shown in\\nthe poets; and finally, after observing how the old Greek custom of\\nwearing belts in gymnastic contests still survived among the more\\nuncivilised Asiatic tribes, he observes that there are many other points\\nin which a likeness may be shown between the life of the primitive\\nHellenes and that of the barbarians to-day.’\\n\\nAs regards the evidence afforded by ancient remains, while adducing as a\\nproof of the insecure character of early Greek society the fact of their\\ncities {31} being always built at some distance from the sea, yet he is\\ncareful to warn us, and the caution ought to be borne in mind by all\\narchæologists, that we have no right to conclude from the scanty remains\\nof any city that its legendary greatness in primitive times was a mere\\nexaggeration.  ‘We are not justified,’ he says, ‘in rejecting the\\ntradition of the magnitude of the Trojan armament, because Mycenæ and the\\nother towns of that age seem to us small and insignificant.  For, if\\nLacedæmon was to become desolate, any antiquarian judging merely from its\\nruins would be inclined to regard the tale of the Spartan hegemony as an\\nidle myth; for the city is a mere collection of villages after the old\\nfashion of Hellas, and has none of those splendid public buildings and\\ntemples which characterise Athens, and whose remains, in the case of the\\nlatter city, would be so marvellous as to lead the superficial observer\\ninto an exaggerated estimate of the Athenian power.’  Nothing can be more\\nscientific than the archæological canons laid down, whose truth is\\nstrikingly illustrated to any one who has compared the waste fields of\\nthe Eurotas plain with the lordly monuments of the Athenian acropolis.\\n{32}\\n\\nOn the other hand, Thucydides is quite conscious of the value of the\\npositive evidence afforded by archæological remains.  He appeals, for\\ninstance, to the character of the armour found in the Delian tombs and\\nthe peculiar mode of sepulture, as corroboration of his theory of the\\npredominance of the Carian element among the primitive islanders, and to\\nthe concentration of all the temples either in the Acropolis, or in its\\nimmediate vicinity, to the name of _ἄστυ_ by which it was still known,\\nand to the extraordinary sanctity of the spring of water there, as proof\\nthat the primitive city was originally confined to the citadel, and the\\ndistrict immediately beneath it (ii. 16).  And lastly, in the very\\nopening of his history, anticipating one of the most scientific of modern\\nmethods, he points out how in early states of civilisation immense\\nfertility of the soil tends to favour the personal aggrandisement of\\nindividuals, and so to stop the normal progress of the country through\\n‘the rise of factions, that endless source of ruin’; and also by the\\nallurements it offers to a foreign invader, to necessitate a continual\\nchange of population, one immigration following on another.  He\\nexemplifies his theory by pointing to the endless political revolutions\\nthat characterised Arcadia, Thessaly and Boeotia, the three richest spots\\nin Greece, as well as by the negative instance of the undisturbed state\\nin primitive time of Attica, which was always remarkable for the dryness\\nand poverty of its soil.\\n\\nNow, while undoubtedly in these passages we may recognise the first\\nanticipation of many of the most modern principles of research, we must\\nremember how essentially limited is the range of the _archæologia_, and\\nhow no theory at all is offered on the wider questions of the general\\nconditions of the rise and progress of humanity, a problem which is first\\nscientifically discussed in the _Republic_ of Plato.\\n\\nAnd at the outset it must be premised that, while the study of primitive\\nman is an essentially inductive science, resting rather on the\\naccumulation of evidence than on speculation, among the Greeks it was\\nprosecuted rather on deductive principles.  Thucydides did, indeed, avail\\nhimself of the opportunities afforded by the unequal development of\\ncivilisation in his own day in Greece, and in the places I have pointed\\nout seems to have anticipated the comparative method.  But we do not find\\nlater writers availing themselves of the wonderfully accurate and\\npicturesque accounts given by Herodotus of the customs of savage tribes.\\nTo take one instance, which bears a good deal on modern questions, we\\nfind in the works of this great traveller the gradual and progressive\\nsteps in the development of the family life clearly manifested in the\\nmere gregarious herding together of the Agathyrsi, their primitive\\nkinsmanship through women in common, and the rise of a feeling of\\npaternity from a state of polyandry.  This tribe stood at that time on\\nthat borderland between umbilical relationship and the family which has\\nbeen such a difficult point for modern anthropologists to find.\\n\\nThe ancient authors, however, are unanimous in insisting that the family\\nis the ultimate unit of society, though, as I have said, an inductive\\nstudy of primitive races, or even the accounts given of them by\\nHerodotus, would have shown them that the _νεοττιὰ ἴδια_ of a personal\\nhousehold, to use Plato’s expression, is really a most complex notion\\nappearing always in a late stage of civilisation, along with recognition\\nof private property and the rights of individualism.\\n\\nPhilology also, which in the hands of modern investigators has proved\\nsuch a splendid instrument of research, was in ancient days studied on\\nprinciples too unscientific to be of much use.  Herodotus points out that\\nthe word _Eridanos_ is essentially Greek in character, that consequently\\nthe river supposed to run round the world is probably a mere Greek\\ninvention.  His remarks, however, on language generally, as in the case\\nof _Piromis_ and the ending of the Persian names, show on what unsound\\nbasis his knowledge of language rested.\\n\\nIn the _Bacchæ_ of Euripides there is an extremely interesting passage in\\nwhich the immoral stories of the Greek mythology are accounted for on the\\nprinciple of that misunderstanding of words and metaphors to which modern\\nscience has given the name of a disease of language.  In answer to the\\nimpious rationalism of Pentheus—a sort of modern Philistine—Teiresias,\\nwho may be termed the Max Müller of the Theban cycle, points out that the\\nstory of Dionysus being inclosed in Zeus’ thigh really arose from the\\nlinguistic confusion between _μηρός_ and _ὅμηρος_.\\n\\nOn the whole, however—for I have quoted these two instances only to show\\nthe unscientific character of early philology—we may say that this\\nimportant instrument in recreating the history of the past was not really\\nused by the ancients as a means of historical criticism.  Nor did the\\nancients employ that other method, used to such advantage in our own day,\\nby which in the symbolism and formulas of an advanced civilisation we can\\ndetect the unconscious survival of ancient customs: for, whereas in the\\nsham capture of the bride at a marriage feast, which was common in Wales\\ntill a recent time, we can discern the lingering reminiscence of the\\nbarbarous habit of exogamy, the ancient writers saw only the deliberate\\ncommemoration of an historical event.\\n\\nAristotle does not tell us by what method he discovered that the Greeks\\nused to buy their wives in primitive times, but, judging by his general\\nprinciples, it was probably through some legend or myth on the subject\\nwhich lasted to his own day, and not, as we would do, by arguing back\\nfrom the marriage presents given to the bride and her relatives. {37}\\n\\nThe origin of the common proverb ‘worth so many beeves,’ in which we\\ndiscern the unconscious survival of a purely pastoral state of society\\nbefore the use of metals was known, is ascribed by Plutarch to the fact\\nof Theseus having coined money bearing a bull’s head.  Similarly, the\\nAmathusian festival, in which a young man imitated the labours of a woman\\nin travail, is regarded by him as a rite instituted in Ariadne’s honour,\\nand the Carian adoration of asparagus as a simple commemoration of the\\nadventure of the nymph Perigune.  In the first of these _we_ discern the\\nbeginning of agnation and kinsmanship through the father, which still\\nlingers in the ‘couvee’ of New Zealand tribes: while the second is a\\nrelic of the totem and fetish worship of plants.\\n\\nNow, in entire opposition to this modern inductive principle of research\\nstands the philosophic Plato, whose account of primitive man is entirely\\nspeculative and deductive.\\n\\nThe origin of society he ascribes to necessity, the mother of all\\ninventions, and imagines that individual man began deliberately to herd\\ntogether on account of the advantages of the principle of division of\\nlabour and the rendering of mutual need.\\n\\nIt must, however, be borne in mind that Plato’s object in this whole\\npassage in the _Republic_ was, perhaps, not so much to analyse the\\nconditions of early society as to illustrate the importance of the\\ndivision of labour, the shibboleth of his political economy, by showing\\nwhat a powerful factor it must have been in the most primitive as well as\\nin the most complex states of society; just as in the _Laws_ he almost\\nrewrites entirely the history of the Peloponnesus in order to prove the\\nnecessity of a balance of power.  He surely, I mean, must have recognised\\nhimself how essentially incomplete his theory was in taking no account of\\nthe origin of family life, the position and influence of women, and other\\nsocial questions, as well as in disregarding those deeper motives of\\nreligion, which are such important factors in early civilisation, and\\nwhose influence Aristotle seems to have clearly apprehended, when he says\\nthat the aim of primitive society was not merely life but the higher\\nlife, and that in the origin of society utility is not the sole motive,\\nbut that there is something spiritual in it if, at least, ‘spiritual’\\nwill bring out the meaning of that complex expression _τὸ καλόν_.\\nOtherwise, the whole account in the _Republic_ of primitive man will\\nalways remain as a warning against the intrusion of _a priori_\\nspeculations in the domain appropriate to induction.\\n\\nNow, Aristotle’s theory of the origin of society, like his philosophy of\\nethics, rests ultimately on the principle of final causes, not in the\\ntheological meaning of an aim or tendency imposed from without, but in\\nthe scientific sense of function corresponding to organ.  ‘Nature maketh\\nno thing in vain’ is the text of Aristotle in this as in other inquiries.\\nMan being the only animal possessed of the power of rational speech is,\\nhe asserts, by nature intended to be social, more so than the bee or any\\nother gregarious animal.\\n\\nHe is _φύσει πολιτικός_, and the national tendency towards higher forms\\nof perfection brings the ‘armed savage who used to sell his wife’ to the\\nfree independence of a free state, and to the _ἰσότης τοῦ ἄρχειν καὶ τοῦ\\nἄρχεσθαι_, which was the test of true citizenship.  The stages passed\\nthrough by humanity start with the family first as the ultimate unit.\\n\\nThe conglomeration of families forms a village ruled by that patriarchal\\nsway which is the oldest form of government in the world, as is shown by\\nthe fact that all men count it to be the constitution of heaven, and the\\nvillages are merged into the state, and here the progression stops.\\n\\nFor Aristotle, like all Greek thinkers, found his ideal within the walls\\nof the _πόλις_, yet perhaps in his remark that a united Greece would rule\\nthe world we may discern some anticipation of that ‘federal union of free\\nstates into one consolidated empire’ which, more than the _πόλις_, is to\\nour eyes the ultimately perfect polity.\\n\\nHow far Aristotle was justified in regarding the family as the ultimate\\nunit, with the materials afforded to him by Greek literature, I have\\nalready noticed.  Besides, Aristotle, I may remark, had he reflected on\\nthe meaning of that Athenian law which, while prohibiting marriage with a\\nuterine sister, permitted it with a sister-german, or on the common\\ntradition in Athens that before the time of Cecrops children bore their\\nmothers’ names, or on some of the Spartan regulations, could hardly have\\nfailed to see the universality of kinsmanship through women in early\\ndays, and the late appearance of monandry.  Yet, while he missed this\\npoint, in common, it must be acknowledged, with many modern writers, such\\nas Sir Henry Maine, it is essentially as an explorer of inductive\\ninstances that we recognise his improvement on Plato.  The treatise _περὶ\\nπολιτείων_, did it remain to us in its entirety, would have been one of\\nthe most valuable landmarks in the progress of historical criticism, and\\nthe first scientific treatise on the science of comparative politics.\\n\\nA few fragments still remain to us, in one of which we find Aristotle\\nappealing to the authority of an ancient inscription on the ‘Disk of\\nIphitus,’ one of the most celebrated Greek antiquities, to corroborate\\nhis theory of the Lycurgean revival of the Olympian festival; while his\\nenormous research is evinced in the elaborate explanation he gives of the\\nhistorical origin of proverbs such as _οὐδεῖς μέγας κακὸς ἰχθῦς_, of\\nreligious songs like the _ἰῶμεν ἐς Ἀθήνας_ of the Botticean virgins, or\\nthe praises of love and war.\\n\\nAnd, finally, it is to be observed how much wider than Plato’s his theory\\nof the origin of society is.  They both rest on a psychological basis,\\nbut Aristotle’s recognition of the capacity for progress and the tendency\\ntowards a higher life shows how much deeper his knowledge of human nature\\nwas.\\n\\nIn imitation of these two philosophers, Polybius gives an account of the\\norigin of society in the opening to his philosophy of history.  Somewhat\\nin the spirit of Plato, he imagines that after one of the cyclic deluges\\nwhich sweep off mankind at stated periods and annihilate all pre-existing\\ncivilisation, the few surviving members of humanity coalesce for mutual\\nprotection, and, as in the case with ordinary animals, the one most\\nremarkable for physical strength is elected king.  In a short time, owing\\nto the workings of sympathy and the desire of approbation, the moral\\nqualities begin to make their appearance, and intellectual instead of\\nbodily excellence becomes the qualification for sovereignty.\\n\\nOther points, as the rise of law and the like, are dwelt on in a somewhat\\nmodern spirit, and although Polybius seems not to have employed the\\ninductive method of research in this question, or rather, I should say,\\nof the hierarchical order of the rational progress of ideas in life, he\\nis not far removed from what the laborious investigations of modern\\ntravellers have given us.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, as regards the working of the speculative faculty in the\\ncreation of history, it is in all respects marvellous how that the most\\ntruthful accounts of the passage from barbarism to civilisation in\\nancient literature come from the works of poets.  The elaborate\\nresearches of Mr. Tylor and Sir John Lubbock have done little more than\\nverify the theories put forward in the _Prometheus Bound_ and the _De\\nNatura Rerum_; yet neither Æschylus nor Lucretias followed in the modern\\npath, but rather attained to truth by a certain almost mystic power of\\ncreative imagination, such as we now seek to banish from science as a\\ndangerous power, though to it science seems to owe many of its most\\nsplendid generalities. {43}\\n\\nLeaving then the question of the origin of society as treated by the\\nancients, I shall now turn to the other and the more important question\\nof how far they may he said to have attained to what we call the\\nphilosophy of history.\\n\\nNow at the outset we must note that, while the conceptions of law and\\norder have been universally received as the governing principles of the\\nphenomena of nature in the sphere of physical science, yet their\\nintrusion into the domain of history and the life of man has always been\\nmet with a strong opposition, on the ground of the incalculable nature of\\ntwo great forces acting on human action, a certain causeless spontaneity\\nwhich men call free will, and the extra-natural interference which they\\nattribute as a constant attribute to God.\\n\\nNow, that there is a science of the apparently variable phenomena of\\nhistory is a conception which _we_ have perhaps only recently begun to\\nappreciate; yet, like all other great thoughts, it seems to have come to\\nthe Greek mind spontaneously, through a certain splendour of imagination,\\nin the morning tide of their civilisation, before inductive research had\\narmed them with the instruments of verification.  For I think it is\\npossible to discern in some of the mystic speculations of the early Greek\\nthinkers that desire to discover what is that ‘invariable existence of\\nwhich there are variable states,’ and to incorporate it in some one\\nformula of law which may serve to explain the different manifestations of\\nall organic bodies, _man included_, which is the germ of the philosophy\\nof history; the germ indeed of an idea of which it is not too much to say\\nthat on it any kind of historical criticism, worthy of the name, must\\nultimately rest.\\n\\nFor the very first requisite for any scientific conception of history is\\nthe doctrine of uniform sequence: in other words, that certain events\\nhaving happened, certain other events corresponding to them will happen\\nalso; that the past is the key of the future.\\n\\nNow at the birth of this great conception science, it is true, presided,\\nyet religion it was which at the outset clothed it in its own garb, and\\nfamiliarised men with it by appealing to their hearts first and then to\\ntheir intellects; knowing that at the beginning of things it is through\\nthe moral nature, and not through the intellectual, that great truths are\\nspread.\\n\\nSo in Herodotus, who may be taken as a representative of the orthodox\\ntone of thought, the idea of the uniform sequence of cause and effect\\nappears under the theological aspect of Nemesis and Providence, which is\\nreally the scientific conception of law, only it is viewed from an\\n_ethical_ standpoint.\\n\\nNow in Thucydides the philosophy of history rests on the probability,\\nwhich the uniformity of human nature affords us, that the future will in\\nthe course of human things resemble the past, if not reproduce it.  He\\nappears to contemplate a recurrence of the phenomena of history as\\nequally certain with a return of the epidemic of the Great Plague.\\n\\nNotwithstanding what German critics have written on the subject, we must\\nbeware of regarding this conception as a mere reproduction of that cyclic\\ntheory of events which sees in the world nothing but the regular rotation\\nof Strophe and Antistrophe, in the eternal choir of life and death.\\n\\nFor, in his remarks on the excesses of the Corcyrean Revolution,\\nThucydides distinctly rests his idea of the recurrence of history on the\\npsychological grounds of the general sameness of mankind.\\n\\n‘The sufferings,’ he says, ‘which revolution entailed upon the cities\\nwere many and terrible, such as have occurred and always will occurs as\\nlong as human nature remains the same, though in a severer or milder\\nform, and varying in their symptoms according to the variety of the\\nparticular cases.\\n\\n‘In peace and prosperity states and individuals have better sentiments,\\nbecause they are not confronted with imperious necessities; but war takes\\naway the easy supply of men’s wants, and so proves a hard taskmaster,\\nwhich brings most men’s characters to a level with their fortunes.’\\n\\n\\n\\nIV\\n\\n\\nIT is evident that here Thucydides is ready to admit the variety of\\nmanifestations which external causes bring about in their workings on the\\nuniform character of the nature of man.  Yet, after all is said, these\\nare perhaps but very general statements: the ordinary effects of peace\\nand war are dwelt on, but there is no real analysis of the immediate\\ncauses and general laws of the phenomena of life, nor does Thucydides\\nseem to recognise the truth that if humanity proceeds in circles, the\\ncircles are always widening.\\n\\nPerhaps we may say that with him the philosophy of history is partly in\\nthe metaphysical stage, and see, in the progress of this idea from\\nHerodotus to Polybius, the exemplification of the Comtian Law of the\\nthree stages of thought, the theological, the metaphysical, and the\\nscientific: for truly out of the vagueness of theological mysticism this\\nconception which we call the Philosophy of History was raised to a\\nscientific principle, according to which the past was explained and the\\nfuture predicted by reference to general laws.\\n\\nNow, just as the earliest account of the nature of the progress of\\nhumanity is to be found in Plato, so in him we find the first explicit\\nattempt to found a universal philosophy of history upon wide rational\\ngrounds.  Having created an ideally perfect state, the philosopher\\nproceeds to give an elaborate theory of the complex causes which produce\\nrevolutions, of the moral effects of various forms of government and\\neducation, of the rise of the criminal classes and their connection with\\npauperism, and, in a word, to create history by the deductive method and\\nto proceed from _a priori_ psychological principles to discover the\\ngoverning laws of the apparent chaos of political life.\\n\\nThere have been many attempts since Plato to deduce from a single\\nphilosophical principle all the phenomena which experience subsequently\\nverifies for us.  Fichte thought he could predict the world-plan from the\\nidea of universal time.  Hegel dreamed he had found the key to the\\nmysteries of life in the development of freedom, and Krause in the\\ncategories of being.  But the one scientific basis on which the true\\nphilosophy of history must rest is the complete knowledge of the laws of\\nhuman nature in all its wants, its aspirations, its powers and its\\ntendencies: and this great truth, which Thucydides may be said in some\\nmeasure to have apprehended, was given to us first by Plato.\\n\\nNow, it cannot be accurately said of this philosopher that either his\\nphilosophy or his history is entirely and simply _a priori_.  _On est de\\nson siècle même quand on y proteste_, and so we find in him continual\\nreferences to the Spartan mode of life, the Pythagorean system, the\\ngeneral characteristics of Greek tyrannies and Greek democracies.  For\\nwhile, in his account of the method of forming an ideal state, he says\\nthat the political artist is indeed to fix his gaze on the sun of\\nabstract truth in the heavens of the pure reason, but is sometimes to\\nturn to the realisation of the ideals on earth: yet, after all, the\\ngeneral character of the Platonic method, which is what we are specially\\nconcerned with, is essentially deductive and _a priori_.  And he himself,\\nin the building up of his Nephelococcygia, certainly starts with a\\n_καθαρὸς πίναξ_, making a clean sweep of all history and all experience;\\nand it was essentially as an _a priori_ theorist that he is criticised by\\nAristotle, as we shall see later.\\n\\nTo proceed to closer details regarding the actual scheme of the laws of\\npolitical revolutions as drawn out by Plato, we must first note that the\\nprimary cause of the decay of the ideal state is the general principle,\\ncommon to the vegetable and animal worlds as well as to the world of\\nhistory, that all created things are fated to decay—a principle which,\\nthough expressed in the terms of a mere metaphysical abstraction, is yet\\nperhaps in its essence scientific.  For we too must hold that a\\ncontinuous redistribution of matter and motion is the inevitable result\\nof the nominal persistence of Force, and that perfect equilibrium is as\\nimpossible in politics as it certainly is in physics.\\n\\nThe secondary causes which mar the perfection of the Platonic ‘city of\\nthe sun’ are to be found in the intellectual decay of the race consequent\\non injudicious marriages and in the Philistine elevation of physical\\nachievements over mental culture; while the hierarchical succession of\\nTimocracy and Oligarchy, Democracy and Tyranny, is dwelt on at great\\nlength and its causes analysed in a very dramatic and psychological\\nmanner, if not in that sanctioned by the actual order of history.\\n\\nAnd indeed it is apparent at first sight that the Platonic succession of\\nstates represents rather the succession of ideas in the philosophic mind\\nthan any historical succession of time.\\n\\nAristotle meets the whole simply by an appeal to facts.  If the theory of\\nthe periodic decay of all created things, he urges, be scientific, it\\nmust be universal, and so true of all the other states as well as of the\\nideal.  Besides, a state usually changes into its contrary and not to the\\nform next to it; so the ideal state would not change into Timocracy;\\nwhile Oligarchy, more often than Tyranny, succeeds Democracy.  Plato,\\nbesides, says nothing of what a Tyranny would change to.  According to\\nthe cycle theory it ought to pass into the ideal state again, but as a\\nfact one Tyranny is changed into another as at Sicyon, or into a\\nDemocracy as at Syracuse, or into an Aristocracy as at Carthage.  The\\nexample of Sicily, too, shows that an Oligarchy is often followed by a\\nTyranny, as at Leontini and Gela.  Besides, it is absurd to represent\\ngreed as the chief motive of decay, or to talk of avarice as the root of\\nOligarchy, when in nearly all true oligarchies money-making is forbidden\\nby law.  And finally the Platonic theory neglects the different kinds of\\ndemocracies and of tyrannies.\\n\\nNow nothing can be more important than this passage in Aristotle’s\\n_Politics_ (_v._ 12.), which may he said to mark an era in the evolution\\nof historical criticism.  For there is nothing on which Aristotle insists\\nso strongly as that the generalisations from facts ought to be added to\\nthe data of the _a priori_ method—a principle which we know to be true\\nnot merely of deductive speculative politics but of physics also: for are\\nnot the residual phenomena of chemists a valuable source of improvement\\nin theory?\\n\\nHis own method is essentially historical though by no means empirical.\\nOn the contrary, this far-seeing thinker, rightly styled _il maestro di\\ncolor che sanno_, may be said to have apprehended clearly that the true\\nmethod is neither exclusively empirical nor exclusively speculative, but\\nrather a union of both in the process called Analysis or the\\nInterpretation of Facts, which has been defined as the application to\\nfacts of such general conceptions as may fix the important\\ncharacteristics of the phenomena, and present them permanently in their\\ntrue relations.  He too was the first to point out, what even in our own\\nday is incompletely appreciated, that nature, including the development\\nof man, is not full of incoherent episodes like a bad tragedy, that\\ninconsistency and anomaly are as impossible in the moral as they are in\\nthe physical world, and that where the superficial observer thinks he\\nsees a revolution the philosophical critic discerns merely the gradual\\nand rational evolution of the inevitable results of certain antecedents.\\n\\nAnd while admitting the necessity of a psychological basis for the\\nphilosophy of history, he added to it the important truth that man, to be\\napprehended in his proper position in the universe as well as in his\\nnatural powers, must be studied from below in the hierarchical\\nprogression of higher function from the lower forms of life.  The\\nimportant maxim, that to obtain a clear conception of anything we must\\n‘study it in its growth from the very beginning,’ is formally set down in\\nthe opening of the _Politics_, where, indeed, we shall find the other\\ncharacteristic features of the modern Evolutionary theory, such as the\\n‘Differentiation of Function’ and the ‘Survival of the Fittest’\\nexplicitly set forth.\\n\\nWhat a valuable step this was in the improvement of the method of\\nhistorical criticism it is needless to point out.  By it, one may say,\\nthe true thread was given to guide one’s steps through the bewildering\\nlabyrinth of facts.  For history (to use terms with which Aristotle has\\nmade us familiar) may be looked at from two essentially different\\nstandpoints; either as a work of art whose _τέλος_ or final cause is\\nexternal to it and imposed on it from without; or as an organism\\ncontaining the law of its own development in itself, and working out its\\nperfection merely by the fact of being what it is.  Now, if we adopt the\\nformer, which we may style the theological view, we shall be in continual\\ndanger of tripping into the pitfall of some _a priori_ conclusion—that\\nbourne from which, it has been truly said, no traveller ever returns.\\n\\nThe latter is the only scientific theory and was apprehended in its\\nfulness by Aristotle, whose application of the inductive method to\\nhistory, and whose employment of the evolutionary theory of humanity,\\nshow that he was conscious that the philosophy of history is nothing\\nseparate from the facts of history but is contained in them, and that the\\nrational law of the complex phenomena of life, like the ideal in the\\nworld of thought, is to be reached through the facts, not superimposed on\\nthem—_κατὰ πολλῶν_ not _παρὰ πολλά_.\\n\\nAnd finally, in estimating the enormous debt which the science of\\nhistorical criticism owes to Aristotle, we must not pass over his\\nattitude towards those two great difficulties in the formation of a\\nphilosophy of history on which I have touched above.  I mean the\\nassertion of extra-natural interference with the normal development of\\nthe world and of the incalculable influence exercised by the power of\\nfree will.\\n\\nNow, as regards the former, he may be said to have neglected it entirely.\\nThe special acts of providence proceeding from God’s immediate government\\nof the world, which Herodotus saw as mighty landmarks in history, would\\nhave been to him essentially disturbing elements in that universal reign\\nof law, the extent of whose limitless empire he of all the great thinkers\\nof antiquity was the first explicitly to recognise.\\n\\nStanding aloof from the popular religion as well as from the deeper\\nconceptions of Herodotus and the Tragic School, he no longer thought of\\nGod as of one with fair limbs and treacherous face haunting wood and\\nglade, nor would he see in him a jealous judge continually interfering in\\nthe world’s history to bring the wicked to punishment and the proud to a\\nfall.  God to him was the incarnation of the pure Intellect, a being\\nwhose activity was the contemplation of his own perfection, one whom\\nPhilosophy might imitate but whom prayers could never move, to the\\nsublime indifference of whose passionless wisdom what were the sons of\\nmen, their desires or their sins?  While, as regards the other difficulty\\nand the formation of a philosophy of history, the conflict of free will\\nwith general laws appears first in Greek thought in the usual theological\\nform in which all great ideas seem to be cradled at their birth.\\n\\nIt was such legends as those of Œdipus and Adrastus, exemplifying the\\nstruggles of individual humanity against the overpowering force of\\ncircumstances and necessity, which gave to the early Greeks those same\\nlessons which we of modern days draw, in somewhat less artistic fashion,\\nfrom the study of statistics and the laws of physiology.\\n\\nIn Aristotle, of course, there is no trace of supernatural influence.\\nThe Furies, which drive their victim into sin first and then punishment,\\nare no longer ‘viper-tressed goddesses with eyes and mouth aflame,’ but\\nthose evil thoughts which harbour within the impure soul.  In this, as in\\nall other points, to arrive at Aristotle is to reach the pure atmosphere\\nof scientific and modern thought.\\n\\nBut while he rejected pure necessitarianism in its crude form as\\nessentially a _reductio ad absurdum_ of life, he was fully conscious of\\nthe fact that the will is not a mysterious and ultimate unit of force\\nbeyond which we cannot go and whose special characteristic is\\ninconsistency, but a certain creative attitude of the mind which is, from\\nthe first, continually influenced by habits, education and circumstance;\\nso absolutely modifiable, in a word, that the good and the bad man alike\\nseem to lose the power of free will; for the one is morally unable to\\nsin, the other physically incapacitated for reformation.\\n\\nAnd of the influence of climate and temperature in forming the nature of\\nman (a conception perhaps pressed too far in modern days when the ‘race\\ntheory’ is supposed to be a sufficient explanation of the Hindoo, and the\\nlatitude and longitude of a country the best guide to its morals {57})\\nAristotle is completely unaware.  I do not allude to such smaller points\\nas the oligarchical tendencies of a horse-breeding country and the\\ndemocratic influence of the proximity of the sea (important though they\\nare for the consideration of Greek history), but rather to those wider\\nviews in the seventh book of his _Politics_, where he attributes the\\nhappy union in the Greek character of intellectual attainments with the\\nspirit of progress to the temperate climate they enjoyed, and points out\\nhow the extreme cold of the north dulls the mental faculties of its\\ninhabitants and renders them incapable of social organisation or extended\\nempire; while to the enervating heat of eastern countries was due that\\nwant of spirit and bravery which then, as now, was the characteristic of\\nthe population in that quarter of the globe.\\n\\nThucydides has shown the causal connection between political revolutions\\nand the fertility of the soil, but goes a step farther and points out the\\npsychological influences on a people’s character exercised by the various\\nextremes of climate—in both cases the first appearance of a most valuable\\nform of historical criticism.\\n\\nTo the development of Dialectic, as to God, intervals of time are of no\\naccount.  From Plato and Aristotle we pass direct to Polybius.\\n\\nThe progress of thought from the philosopher of the Academe to the\\nArcadian historian may be best illustrated by a comparison of the method\\nby which each of the three writers, whom I have selected as the highest\\nexpression of the rationalism of his respective age, attained to his\\nideal state: for the latter conception may be in a measure regarded as\\nrepresenting the most spiritual principle which they could discern in\\nhistory.\\n\\nNow, Plato created his on _a priori_ principles; Aristotle formed his by\\nan analysis of existing constitutions; Polybius found his realised for\\nhim in the actual world of fact.  Aristotle criticised the deductive\\nspeculations of Plato by means of inductive negative instances, but\\nPolybius will not take the ‘Cloud City’ of the _Republic_ into account at\\nall.  He compares it to an athlete who has never run on ‘Constitution\\nHill,’ to a statue so beautiful that it is entirely removed from the\\nordinary conditions of humanity, and consequently from the canons of\\ncriticism.\\n\\nThe Roman state had attained in his eyes, by means of the mutual\\ncounteraction of three opposing forces, {59} that stable equilibrium in\\npolitics which was the ideal of all the theoretical writers of antiquity.\\nAnd in connection with this point it will be convenient to notice here\\nhow much truth there is contained in the accusation often brought against\\nthe ancients that they knew nothing of the idea of Progress, for the\\nmeaning of many of their speculations will be hidden from us if we do not\\ntry and comprehend first what their aim was, and secondly why it was so.\\n\\nNow, like all wide generalities, this statement is at least inaccurate.\\nThe prayer of Plato’s ideal City—_ἐξ ἀγαθῶν ἀμείνους_, _καὶ ἐξ ὠφελιμῶν\\nὠφελιμωτέρους ἀεὶ τοὺς ἐκγόνους γίγνεσθαι_, might be written as a text\\nover the door of the last Temple to Humanity raised by the disciples of\\nFourier and Saint-Simon, but it is certainly true that their ideal\\nprinciple was order and permanence, not indefinite progress.  For,\\nsetting aside the artistic prejudices which would have led the Greeks to\\nreject this idea of unlimited improvement, we may note that the modern\\nconception of progress rests partly on the new enthusiasm and worship of\\nhumanity, partly on the splendid hopes of material improvements in\\ncivilisation which applied science has held out to us, two influences\\nfrom which ancient Greek thought seems to have been strangely free.  For\\nthe Greeks marred the perfect humanism of the great men whom they\\nworshipped, by imputing to them divinity and its supernatural powers;\\nwhile their science was eminently speculative and often almost mystic in\\nits character, aiming at culture and not utility, at higher spirituality\\nand more intense reverence for law, rather than at the increased\\nfacilities of locomotion and the cheap production of common things about\\nwhich our modern scientific school ceases not to boast.  And lastly, and\\nperhaps chiefly, we must remember that the ‘plague spot of all Greek\\nstates,’ as one of their own writers has called it, was the terrible\\ninsecurity to life and property which resulted from the factions and\\nrevolutions which ceased not to trouble Greece at all times, raising a\\nspirit of fanaticism such as religion raised in the middle ages of\\nEurope.\\n\\nThese considerations, then, will enable us to understand first how it was\\nthat, radical and unscrupulous reformers as the Greek political theorists\\nwere, yet, their end once attained, no modern conservatives raised such\\noutcry against the slightest innovation.  Even acknowledged improvements\\nin such things as the games of children or the modes of music were\\nregarded by them with feelings of extreme apprehension as the herald of\\nthe _drapeau rouge_ of reform.  And secondly, it will show us how it was\\nthat Polybius found his ideal in the commonwealth of Rome, and Aristotle,\\nlike Mr. Bright, in the middle classes.  Polybius, however, is not\\ncontent merely with pointing out his ideal state, but enters at\\nconsiderable length into the question of those general laws whose\\nconsideration forms the chief essential of the philosophy of history.\\n\\nHe starts by accepting the general principle that all things are fated to\\ndecay (which I noticed in the case of Plato), and that ‘as iron produces\\nrust and as wood breeds the animals that destroy it, so every state has\\nin it the seeds of its own corruption.’  He is not, however, content to\\nrest there, but proceeds to deal with the more immediate causes of\\nrevolutions, which he says are twofold in nature, either external or\\ninternal.  Now, the former, depending as they do on the synchronous\\nconjunction of other events outside the sphere of scientific estimation,\\nare from their very character incalculable; but the latter, though\\nassuming many forms, always result from the over-great preponderance of\\nany single element to the detriment of the others, the rational law lying\\nat the base of all varieties of political changes being that stability\\ncan result only from the statical equilibrium produced by the\\ncounteraction of opposing parts, since the more simple a constitution is\\nthe more it is insecure.  Plato had pointed out before how the extreme\\nliberty of a democracy always resulted in despotism, but Polybius\\nanalyses the law and shows the scientific principles on which it rests.\\n\\nThe doctrine of the instability of pure constitutions forms an important\\nera in the philosophy of history.  Its special applicability to the\\npolitics of our own day has been illustrated in the rise of the great\\nNapoleon, when the French state had lost those divisions of caste and\\nprejudice, of landed aristocracy and moneyed interest, institutions in\\nwhich the vulgar see only barriers to Liberty but which are indeed the\\nonly possible defences against the coming of that periodic Sirius of\\npolitics, the _τύραννος ἐκ προστατικῆς ῥίζης_.\\n\\nThere is a principle which Tocqueville never wearies of explaining, and\\nwhich has been subsumed by Mr. Herbert Spencer under that general law\\ncommon to all organic bodies which we call the Instability of the\\nHomogeneous.  The various manifestations of this law, as shown in the\\nnormal, regular revolutions and evolutions of the different forms of\\ngovernment, {63a} are expounded with great clearness by Polybius, who\\nclaimed for his theory, in the Thucydidean spirit, that it is a _κτῆμα ἐς\\nἀεί_, not a mere _ἀγώνισμα ἐς τὸ παραχρῆμα_, and that a knowledge of it\\nwill enable the impartial observer {63b} to discover at any time what\\nperiod of its constitutional evolution any particular state has already\\nreached and into what form it will be next differentiated, though\\npossibly the exact time of the changes may be more or less uncertain.\\n{63c}\\n\\nNow in this necessarily incomplete account of the laws of political\\nrevolutions as expounded by Polybius enough perhaps has been said to show\\nwhat is his true position in the rational development of the ‘Idea’ which\\nI have called the Philosophy of History, because it is the unifying of\\nhistory.  Seen darkly as it is through the glass of religion in the pages\\nof Herodotus, more metaphysical than scientific with Thucydides, Plato\\nstrove to seize it by the eagle-flight of speculation, to reach it with\\nthe eager grasp of a soul impatient of those slower and surer inductive\\nmethods which Aristotle, in his trenchant criticism of his greater\\nmaster, showed were more brilliant than any vague theory, if the test of\\nbrilliancy is truth.\\n\\nWhat then is the position of Polybius?  Does any new method remain for\\nhim?  Polybius was one of those many men who are born too late to be\\noriginal.  To Thucydides belongs the honour of being the first in the\\nhistory of Greek thought to discern the supreme calm of law and order\\nunderlying the fitful storms of life, and Plato and Aristotle each\\nrepresents a great new principle.  To Polybius belongs the office—how\\nnoble an office he made it his writings show—of making more explicit the\\nideas which were implicit in his predecessors, of showing that they were\\nof wider applicability and perhaps of deeper meaning than they had seemed\\nbefore, of examining with more minuteness the laws which they had\\ndiscovered, and finally of pointing out more clearly than any one had\\ndone the range of science and the means it offered for analysing the\\npresent and predicting what was to come.  His office thus was to gather\\nup what they had left, to give their principles new life by a wider\\napplication.\\n\\nPolybius ends this great diapason of Greek thought.  When the Philosophy\\nof history appears next, as in Plutarch’s tract on ‘Why God’s anger is\\ndelayed,’ the pendulum of thought had swung back to where it began.  His\\ntheory was introduced to the Romans under the cultured style of Cicero,\\nand was welcomed by them as the philosophical panegyric of their state.\\nThe last notice of it in Latin literature is in the pages of Tacitus, who\\nalludes to the stable polity formed out of these elements as a\\nconstitution easier to commend than to produce and in no case lasting.\\nYet Polybius had seen the future with no uncertain eye, and had\\nprophesied the rise of the Empire from the unbalanced power of the\\nochlocracy fifty years and more before there was joy in the Julian\\nhousehold over the birth of that boy who, born to power as the champion\\nof the people, died wearing the purple of a king.\\n\\nNo attitude of historical criticism is more important than the means by\\nwhich the ancients attained to the philosophy of history.  The principle\\nof heredity can be exemplified in literature as well as in organic life:\\nAristotle, Plato and Polybius are the lineal ancestors of Fichte and\\nHegel, of Vico and Cousin, of Montesquieu and Tocqueville.\\n\\nAs my aim is not to give an account of historians but to point out those\\ngreat thinkers whose methods have furthered the advance of this spirit of\\nhistorical criticism, I shall pass over those annalists and chroniclers\\nwho intervened between Thucydides and Polybius.  Yet perhaps it may serve\\nto throw new light on the real nature of this spirit and its intimate\\nconnection with all other forms of advanced thought if I give some\\nestimate of the character and rise of those many influences prejudicial\\nto the scientific study of history which cause such a wide gap between\\nthese two historians.\\n\\nForemost among these is the growing influence of rhetoric and the\\nIsocratean school, which seems to have regarded history as an arena for\\nthe display either of pathos or paradoxes, not a scientific investigation\\ninto laws.\\n\\nThe new age is the age of style.  The same spirit of exclusive attention\\nto form which made Euripides often, like Swinburne, prefer music to\\nmeaning and melody to morality, which gave to the later Greek statues\\nthat refined effeminacy, that overstrained gracefulness of attitude, was\\nfelt in the sphere of history.  The rules laid down for historical\\ncomposition are those relating to the æsthetic value of digressions, the\\nlegality of employing more than one metaphor in the same sentence, and\\nthe like; and historians are ranked not by their power of estimating\\nevidence but by the goodness of the Greek they write.\\n\\nI must note also the important influence on literature exercised by\\nAlexander the Great; for while his travels encouraged the more accurate\\nresearch of geography, the very splendour of his achievements seems to\\nhave brought history again into the sphere of romance.  The appearance of\\nall great men in the world is followed invariably by the rise of that\\nmythopœic spirit and that tendency to look for the marvellous, which is\\nso fatal to true historical criticism.  An Alexander, a Napoleon, a\\nFrancis of Assisi and a Mahomet are thought to be outside the limiting\\nconditions of rational law, just as comets were supposed to be not very\\nlong ago.  While the founding of that city of Alexandria, in which\\nWestern and Eastern thought met with such strange result to both,\\ndiverted the critical tendencies of the Greek spirit into questions of\\ngrammar, philology and the like, the narrow, artificial atmosphere of\\nthat University town (as we may call it) was fatal to the development of\\nthat independent and speculative spirit of research which strikes out new\\nmethods of inquiry, of which historical criticism is one.\\n\\nThe Alexandrines combined a great love of learning with an ignorance of\\nthe true principles of research, an enthusiastic spirit for accumulating\\nmaterials with a wonderful incapacity to use them.  Not among the hot\\nsands of Egypt, or the Sophists of Athens, but from the very heart of\\nGreece rises the man of genius on whose influence in the evolution of the\\nphilosophy of history I have a short time ago dwelt.  Born in the serene\\nand pure air of the clear uplands of Arcadia, Polybius may be said to\\nreproduce in his work the character of the place which gave him birth.\\nFor, of all the historians—I do not say of antiquity but of all time—none\\nis more rationalistic than he, none more free from any belief in the\\n‘visions and omens, the monstrous legends, the grovelling superstitions\\nand unmanly craving for the supernatural’ (_δεισιδαιμονίας ἀγεννοῦς καὶ\\nτερατείας γυναικώδους_ {68}) which he himself is compelled to notice as\\nthe characteristics of some of the historians who preceded him.\\nFortunate in the land which bore him, he was no less blessed in the\\nwondrous time of his birth.  For, representing in himself the spiritual\\nsupremacy of the Greek intellect and allied in bonds of chivalrous\\nfriendship to the world-conqueror of his day, he seems led as it were by\\nthe hand of Fate ‘to comprehend,’ as has been said, ‘more clearly than\\nthe Romans themselves the historical position of Rome,’ and to discern\\nwith greater insight than all other men could those two great resultants\\nof ancient civilisation, the material empire of the city of the seven\\nhills, and the intellectual sovereignty of Hellas.\\n\\nBefore his own day, he says, {69a} the events of the world were\\nunconnected and separate and the histories confined to particular\\ncountries.  Now, for the first time the universal empire of the Romans\\nrendered a universal history possible. {69b}  This, then, is the august\\nmotive of his work: to trace the gradual rise of this Italian city from\\nthe day when the first legion crossed the narrow strait of Messina and\\nlanded on the fertile fields of Sicily to the time when Corinth in the\\nEast and Carthage in the West fell before the resistless wave of empire\\nand the eagles of Rome passed on the wings of universal victory from\\nCalpe and the Pillars of Hercules to Syria and the Nile.  At the same\\ntime he recognised that the scheme of Rome’s empire was worked out under\\nthe ægis of God’s will. {69c}  For, as one of the Middle Age scribes most\\ntruly says, the _τύχη_ of Polybius is that power which we Christians call\\nGod; the second aim, as one may call it, of his history is to point out\\nthe rational and human and natural causes which brought this result,\\ndistinguishing, as we should say, between God’s mediate and immediate\\ngovernment of the world.\\n\\nWith any direct intervention of God in the normal development of Man, he\\nwill have nothing to do: still less with any idea of chance as a factor\\nin the phenomena of life.  Chance and miracles, he says, are mere\\nexpressions for our ignorance of rational causes.  The spirit of\\nrationalism which we recognised in Herodotus as a vague uncertain\\nattitude and which appears in Thucydides as a consistent attitude of mind\\nnever argued about or even explained, is by Polybius analysed and\\nformulated as the great instrument of historical research.\\n\\nHerodotus, while believing on principle in the supernatural, yet was\\nsceptical at times.  Thucydides simply ignored the supernatural.  He did\\nnot discuss it, but he annihilated it by explaining history without it.\\nPolybius enters at length into the whole question and explains its origin\\nand the method of treating it.  Herodotus would have believed in Scipio’s\\ndream.  Thucydides would have ignored it entirely.  Polybius explains it.\\nHe is the culmination of the rational progression of Dialectic.\\n‘Nothing,’ he says, ‘shows a foolish mind more than the attempt to\\naccount for any phenomena on the principle of chance or supernatural\\nintervention.  History is a search for rational causes, and there is\\nnothing in the world—even those phenomena which seem to us the most\\nremote from law and improbable—which is not the logical and inevitable\\nresult of certain rational antecedents.’\\n\\nSome things, of course, are to be rejected _a priori_ without entering\\ninto the subject: ‘As regards such miracles,’ he says, {71} ‘as that on a\\ncertain statue of Artemis rain or snow never falls though the statue\\nstands in the open air, or that those who enter God’s shrine in Arcadia\\nlose their natural shadows, I cannot really be expected to argue upon the\\nsubject.  For these things are not only utterly improbable but absolutely\\nimpossible.’\\n\\n‘For us to argue reasonably on an acknowledged absurdity is as vain a\\ntask as trying to catch water in a sieve; it is really to admit the\\npossibility of the supernatural, which is the very point at issue.’\\n\\nWhat Polybius felt was that to admit the possibility of a miracle is to\\nannihilate the possibility of history: for just as scientific and\\nchemical experiments would be either impossible or useless if exposed to\\nthe chance of continued interference on the part of some foreign body, so\\nthe laws and principles which govern history, the causes of phenomena,\\nthe evolution of progress, the whole science, in a word, of man’s\\ndealings with his own race and with nature, will remain a sealed book to\\nhim who admits the possibility of extra-natural interference.\\n\\nThe stories of miracles, then, are to be rejected on _a priori_ rational\\ngrounds, but in the case of events which we know to have happened the\\nscientific historian will not rest till he has discovered their natural\\ncauses which, for instance, in the case of the wonderful rise of the\\nRoman Empire—the most marvellous thing, Polybius says, which God ever\\nbrought about {72a}—are to be found in the excellence of their\\nconstitution (_τῇ ἰδιότητι τῆς πολιτείας_), the wisdom of their advisers,\\ntheir splendid military arrangements, and their superstition (_τῇ\\nδεισιδαιμονίᾳ_).  For while Polybius regarded the revealed religion as,\\nof course, objective reality of truth, {72b} he laid great stress on its\\nmoral subjective influence, going, in one passage on the subject, even so\\nfar as almost to excuse the introduction of the supernatural in very\\nsmall quantities into history on account of the extremely good effect it\\nwould have on pious people.\\n\\nBut perhaps there is no passage in the whole of ancient and modern\\nhistory which breathes such a manly and splendid spirit of rationalism as\\none preserved to us in the Vatican—strange resting-place for it!—in which\\nhe treats of the terrible decay of population which had fallen on his\\nnative land in his own day, and which by the general orthodox public was\\nregarded as a special judgment of God sending childlessness on women as a\\npunishment for the sins of the people.  For it was a disaster quite\\nwithout parallel in the history of the land, and entirely unforeseen by\\nany of its political-economy writers who, on the contrary, were always\\nanticipating that danger would arise from an excess of population\\noverrunning its means of subsistence, and becoming unmanageable through\\nits size.  Polybius, however, will have nothing to do with either priest\\nor worker of miracles in this matter.  He will not even seek that ‘sacred\\nHeart of Greece,’ Delphi, Apollo’s shrine, whose inspiration even\\nThucydides admitted and before whose wisdom Socrates bowed.  How foolish,\\nhe says, were the man who on this matter would pray to God.  We must\\nsearch for the rational causes, and the causes are seen to be clear, and\\nthe method of prevention also.  He then proceeds to notice how all this\\narose from the general reluctance to marriage and to bearing the expense\\nof educating a large family which resulted from the carelessness and\\navarice of the men of his day, and he explains on entirely rational\\nprinciples the whole of this apparently supernatural judgment.\\n\\nNow, it is to be borne in mind that while his rejection of miracles as\\nviolation of inviolable laws is entirely _a priori_—for discussion of\\nsuch a matter is, of course, impossible for a rational thinker—yet his\\nrejection of supernatural intervention rests entirely on the scientific\\ngrounds of the necessity of looking for natural causes.  And he is quite\\nlogical in maintaining his position on these principles.  For, where it\\nis either difficult or impossible to assign any rational cause for\\nphenomena, or to discover their laws, he acquiesces reluctantly in the\\nalternative of admitting some extra-natural interference which his\\nessentially scientific method of treating the matter has logically forced\\non him, approving, for instance, of prayers for rain, on the express\\nground that the laws of meteorology had not yet been ascertained.  He\\nwould, of course, have been the first to welcome our modern discoveries\\nin the matter.  The passage in question is in every way one of the most\\ninteresting in his whole work, not, of course, as signifying any\\ninclination on his part to acquiesce in the supernatural, but because it\\nshows how essentially logical and rational his method of argument was,\\nand how candid and fair his mind.\\n\\nHaving now examined Polybius’s attitude towards the supernatural and the\\ngeneral ideas which guided his research, I will proceed to examine the\\nmethod he pursued in his scientific investigation of the complex\\nphenomena of life.  For, as I have said before in the course of this\\nessay, what is important in all great writers is not so much the results\\nthey arrive at as the methods they pursue.  The increased knowledge of\\nfacts may alter any conclusion in history as in physical science, and the\\ncanons of speculative historical credibility must be acknowledged to\\nappeal rather to that subjective attitude of mind which we call the\\nhistoric sense than to any formulated objective rules.  But a scientific\\nmethod is a gain for all time, and the true if not the only progress of\\nhistorical criticism consists in the improvement of the instruments of\\nresearch.\\n\\nNow first, as regards his conception of history, I have already pointed\\nout that it was to him essentially a search for causes, a problem to be\\nsolved, not a picture to be painted, a scientific investigation into laws\\nand tendencies, not a mere romantic account of startling incident and\\nwondrous adventure.  Thucydides, in the opening of his great work, had\\nsounded the first note of the scientific conception of history.  ‘The\\nabsence of romance in my pages,’ he says, ‘will, I fear, detract somewhat\\nfrom its value, but I have written my work not to be the exploit of a\\npassing hour but as the possession of all time.’ {76}  Polybius follows\\nwith words almost entirely similar.  If, he says, we banish from history\\nthe consideration of causes, methods and motives (_τὸ διὰ τί_, _καὶ πως_,\\n_καὶ τίνος χάριν_), and refuse to consider how far the result of anything\\nis its rational consequent, what is left is a mere _ἀγώνισμα_, not a\\n_μάθημα_, an oratorical essay which may give pleasure for the moment, but\\nwhich is entirely without any scientific value for the explanation of the\\nfuture.  Elsewhere he says that ‘history robbed of the exposition of its\\ncauses and laws is a profitless thing, though it may allure a fool.’  And\\nall through his history the same point is put forward and exemplified in\\nevery fashion.\\n\\nSo far for the conception of history.  Now for the groundwork.  As\\nregards the character of the phenomena to be selected by the scientific\\ninvestigator, Aristotle had laid down the general formula that nature\\nshould be studied in her normal manifestations.  Polybius, true to his\\ncharacter of applying explicitly the principles implicit in the work of\\nothers, follows out the doctrine of Aristotle, and lays particular stress\\non the rational and undisturbed character of the development of the Roman\\nconstitution as affording special facilities for the discovery of the\\nlaws of its progress.  Political revolutions result from causes either\\nexternal or internal.  The former are mere disturbing forces which lie\\noutside the sphere of scientific calculation.  It is the latter which are\\nimportant for the establishing of principles and the elucidation of the\\nsequences of rational evolution.\\n\\nHe thus may be said to have anticipated one of the most important truths\\nof the modern methods of investigation: I mean that principle which lays\\ndown that just as the study of physiology should precede the study of\\npathology, just as the laws of disease are best discovered by the\\nphenomena presented in health, so the method of arriving at all great\\nsocial and political truths is by the investigation of those cases where\\ndevelopment has been normal, rational and undisturbed.\\n\\nThe critical canon that the more a people has been interfered with, the\\nmore difficult it becomes to generalise the laws of its progress and to\\nanalyse the separate forces of its civilisation, is one the validity of\\nwhich is now generally recognised by those who pretend to a scientific\\ntreatment of all history: and while we have seen that Aristotle\\nanticipated it in a general formula, to Polybius belongs the honour of\\nbeing the first to apply it explicitly in the sphere of history.\\n\\nI have shown how to this great scientific historian the motive of his\\nwork was essentially the search for causes; and true to his analytical\\nspirit he is careful to examine what a cause really is and in what part\\nof the antecedents of any consequent it is to be looked for.  To give an\\nillustration: As regards the origin of the war with Perseus, some\\nassigned as causes the expulsion of Abrupolis by Perseus, the expedition\\nof the latter to Delphi, the plot against Eumenes and the seizure of the\\nambassadors in Bœotia; of these incidents the two former, Polybius points\\nout, were merely the pretexts, the two latter merely the occasions of the\\nwar.  The war was really a legacy left to Perseus by his father, who was\\ndetermined to fight it out with Rome. {78}\\n\\nHere as elsewhere he is not originating any new idea.  Thucydides had\\npointed out the difference between the real and the alleged cause, and\\nthe Aristotelian dictum about revolutions, _οὐ περὶ μικρῶν ἀλλ’ ἐκ\\nμικρῶν_, draws the distinction between cause and occasion with the\\nbrilliancy of an epigram.  But the explicit and rational investigation of\\nthe difference between _αἰτία_, _ἀρχὴ_, and _πρόφασις_ was reserved for\\nPolybius.  No canon of historical criticism can be said to be of more\\nreal value than that involved in this distinction, and the overlooking of\\nit has filled our histories with the contemptible accounts of the\\nintrigues of courtiers and of kings and the petty plottings of backstairs\\ninfluence—particulars interesting, no doubt, to those who would ascribe\\nthe Reformation to Anne Boleyn’s pretty face, the Persian war to the\\ninfluence of a doctor or a curtain-lecture from Atossa, or the French\\nRevolution to Madame de Maintenon, but without any value for those who\\naim at any scientific treatment of history.\\n\\nBut the question of method, to which I am compelled always to return, is\\nnot yet exhausted.  There is another aspect in which it may be regarded,\\nand I shall now proceed to treat of it.\\n\\nOne of the greatest difficulties with which the modern historian has to\\ncontend is the enormous complexity of the facts which come under his\\nnotice: D’Alembert’s suggestion that at the end of every century a\\nselection of facts should be made and the rest burned (if it was really\\nintended seriously) could not, of course, be entertained for a moment.  A\\nproblem loses all its value when it becomes simplified, and the world\\nwould be all the poorer if the Sibyl of History burned her volumes.\\nBesides, as Gibbon pointed out, ‘a Montesquieu will detect in the most\\ninsignificant fact relations which the vulgar overlook.’\\n\\nNor can the scientific investigator of history isolate the particular\\nelements, which he desires to examine, from disturbing and extraneous\\ncauses, as the experimental chemist can do (though sometimes, as in the\\ncase of lunatic asylums and prisons, he is enabled to observe phenomena\\nin a certain degree of isolation).  So he is compelled either to use the\\ndeductive mode of arguing from general laws or to employ the method of\\nabstraction, which gives a fictitious isolation to phenomena never so\\nisolated in actual existence.  And this is exactly what Polybius has done\\nas well as Thucydides.  For, as has been well remarked, there is in the\\nworks of these two writers a certain plastic unity of type and motive;\\nwhatever they write is penetrated through and through with a specific\\nquality, a singleness and concentration of purpose, which we may contrast\\nwith the more comprehensive width as manifested not merely in the modern\\nmind, but also in Herodotus.  Thucydides, regarding society as influenced\\nentirely by political motives, took no account of forces of a different\\nnature, and consequently his results, like those of most modern political\\neconomists, have to be modified largely {81} before they come to\\ncorrespond with what we know was the actual state of fact.  Similarly,\\nPolybius will deal only with those forces which tended to bring the\\ncivilised world under the dominion of Rome (ix. 1), and in the\\nThucydidean spirit points out the want of picturesqueness and romance in\\nhis pages which is the result of the abstract method (_τὸ μονοειδὲς τῆς\\nσυντάξεως_) being careful also to tell us that his rejection of all other\\nforces is essentially deliberate and the result of a preconceived theory\\nand by no means due to carelessness of any kind.\\n\\nNow, of the general value of the abstract method and the legality of its\\nemployment in the sphere of history, this is perhaps not the suitable\\noccasion for any discussion.  It is, however, in all ways worthy of note\\nthat Polybius is not merely conscious of, but dwells with particular\\nweight on, the fact which is usually urged as the strongest objection to\\nthe employment of the abstract method—I mean the conception of a society\\nas a sort of human organism whose parts are indissolubly connected with\\none another and all affected when one member is in any way agitated.\\nThis conception of the organic nature of society appears first in Plato\\nand Aristotle, who apply it to cities.  Polybius, as his wont is, expands\\nit to be a general characteristic of all history.  It is an idea of the\\nvery highest importance, especially to a man like Polybius whose thoughts\\nare continually turned towards the essential unity of history and the\\nimpossibility of isolation.\\n\\nFarther, as regards the particular method of investigating that group of\\nphenomena obtained for him by the abstract method, he will adopt, he\\ntells us, neither the purely deductive nor the purely inductive mode but\\nthe union of both.  In other words, he formally adopts that method of\\nanalysis upon the importance of which I have dwelt before.\\n\\nAnd lastly, while, without doubt, enormous simplicity in the elements\\nunder consideration is the result of the employment of the abstract\\nmethod, even within the limit thus obtained a certain selection must be\\nmade, and a selection involves a theory.  For the facts of life cannot be\\ntabulated with as great an ease as the colours of birds and insects can\\nbe tabulated.  Now, Polybius points out that those phenomena particularly\\nare to be dwelt on which may serve as a _παράδειγμα_ or sample, and show\\nthe character of the tendencies of the age as clearly as ‘a single drop\\nfrom a full cask will be enough to disclose the nature of the whole\\ncontents.’  This recognition of the importance of single facts, not in\\nthemselves but because of the spirit they represent, is extremely\\nscientific; for we know that from the single bone, or tooth even, the\\nanatomist can recreate entirely the skeleton of the primeval horse, and\\nthe botanist tell the character of the flora and fauna of a district from\\na single specimen.\\n\\nRegarding truth as ‘the most divine thing in Nature,’ the very ‘eye and\\nlight of history without which it moves a blind thing,’ Polybius spared\\nno pains in the acquisition of historical materials or in the study of\\nthe sciences of politics and war, which he considered were so essential\\nto the training of the scientific historian, and the labour he took is\\nmirrored in the many ways in which he criticises other authorities.\\n\\nThere is something, as a rule, slightly contemptible about ancient\\ncriticism.  The modern idea of the critic as the interpreter, the\\nexpounder of the beauty and excellence of the work he selects, seems\\nquite unknown.  Nothing can be more captious or unfair, for instance,\\nthan the method by which Aristotle criticised the ideal state of Plato in\\nhis ethical works, and the passages quoted by Polybius from Timæus show\\nthat the latter historian fully deserved the punning name given to him.\\nBut in Polybius there is, I think, little of that bitterness and\\npettiness of spirit which characterises most other writers, and an\\nincidental story he tells of his relations with one of the historians\\nwhom he criticised shows that he was a man of great courtesy and\\nrefinement of taste—as, indeed, befitted one who had lived always in the\\nsociety of those who were of great and noble birth.\\n\\nNow, as regards the character of the canons by which he criticises the\\nworks of other authors, in the majority of cases he employs simply his\\nown geographical and military knowledge, showing, for instance, the\\nimpossibility in the accounts given of Nabis’s march from Sparta simply\\nby his acquaintance with the spots in question; or the inconsistency of\\nthose of the battle of Issus; or of the accounts given by Ephorus of the\\nbattles of Leuctra and Mantinea.  In the latter case he says, if any one\\nwill take the trouble to measure out the ground of the site of the battle\\nand then test the manœuvres given, he will find how inaccurate the\\naccounts are.\\n\\nIn other cases he appeals to public documents, the importance of which he\\nwas always foremost in recognising; showing, for instance, by a document\\nin the public archives of Rhodes how inaccurate were the accounts given\\nof the battle of Lade by Zeno and Antisthenes.  Or he appeals to\\npsychological probability, rejecting, for instance, the scandalous\\nstories told of Philip of Macedon, simply from the king’s general\\ngreatness of character, and arguing that a boy so well educated and so\\nrespectably connected as Demochares (xii. 14) could never have been\\nguilty of that of which evil rumour accused him.\\n\\nBut the chief object of his literary censure is Timæus, who had been\\nunsparing of his strictures on others.  The general point which he makes\\nagainst him, impugning his accuracy as a historian, is that he derived\\nhis knowledge of history not from the dangerous perils of a life of\\naction but in the secure indolence of a narrow scholastic life.  There\\nis, indeed, no point on which he is so vehement as this.  ‘A history,’ he\\nsays, ‘written in a library gives as lifeless and as inaccurate a picture\\nof history as a painting which is copied not from a living animal but\\nfrom a stuffed one.’\\n\\nThere is more difference, he says in another place, between the history\\nof an eye-witness and that of one whose knowledge comes from books, than\\nthere is between the scenes of real life and the fictitious landscapes of\\ntheatrical scenery.  Besides this, he enters into somewhat elaborate\\ndetailed criticism of passages where he thought Timæus was following a\\nwrong method and perverting truth, passages which it will be worth while\\nto examine in detail.\\n\\nTimæus, from the fact of there being a Roman custom to shoot a war-horse\\non a stated day, argued back to the Trojan origin of that people.\\nPolybius, on the other hand, points out that the inference is quite\\nunwarrantable, because horse-sacrifices are ordinary institutions common\\nto all barbarous tribes.  Timæus here, as was common with Greek writers,\\nis arguing back from some custom of the present to an historical event in\\nthe past.  Polybius really is employing the comparative method, showing\\nhow the custom was an ordinary step in the civilisation of every early\\npeople.\\n\\nIn another place, {86} he shows how illogical is the scepticism of Timæus\\nas regards the existence of the Bull of Phalaris simply by appealing to\\nthe statue of the Bull, which was still to be seen in Carthage; pointing\\nout how impossible it was, on any other theory except that it belonged to\\nPhalaris, to account for the presence in Carthage of a bull of this\\npeculiar character with a door between his shoulders.  But one of the\\ngreat points which he uses against this Sicilian historian is in\\nreference to the question of the origin of the Locrian colony.  In\\naccordance with the received tradition on the subject, Aristotle had\\nrepresented the Locrian colony as founded by some Parthenidæ or slaves’\\nchildren, as they were called, a statement which seems to have roused the\\nindignation of Timæus, who went to a good deal of trouble to confute this\\ntheory.  He does so on the following grounds:—\\n\\nFirst of all, he points out that in the ancient days the Greeks had no\\nslaves at all, so the mention of them in the matter is an anachronism;\\nand next he declares that he was shown in the Greek city of Locris\\ncertain ancient inscriptions in which their relation to the Italian city\\nwas expressed in terms of the position between parent and child, which\\nshowed also that mutual rights of citizenship were accorded to each city.\\nBesides this, he appeals to various questions of improbability as regards\\ntheir international relationship, on which Polybius takes diametrically\\nopposite grounds which hardly call for discussion.  And in favour of his\\nown view he urges two points more: first, that the Lacedæmonians being\\nallowed furlough for the purpose of seeing their wives at home, it was\\nunlikely that the Locrians should not have had the same privilege; and\\nnext, that the Italian Locrians knew nothing of the Aristotelian version\\nand had, on the contrary, very severe laws against adulterers, runaway\\nslaves and the like.  Now, most of these questions rest on mere\\nprobability, which is always such a subjective canon that an appeal to it\\nis rarely conclusive.  I would note, however, as regards the inscriptions\\nwhich, if genuine, would of course have settled the matter, that Polybius\\nlooks on them as a mere invention on the part of Timæus, who, he remarks,\\ngives no details about them, though, as a rule, he is over-anxious to\\ngive chapter and verse for everything.  A somewhat more interesting point\\nis that where he attacks Timæus for the introduction of fictitious\\nspeeches into his narrative; for on this point Polybius seems to be far\\nin advance of the opinions held by literary men on the subject not merely\\nin his own day, but for centuries after.\\n\\nHerodotus had introduced speeches avowedly dramatic and fictitious.\\nThucydides states clearly that, where he was unable to find out what\\npeople really said, he put down what they ought to have said.  Sallust\\nalludes, it is true, to the fact of the speech he puts into the mouth of\\nthe tribune Memmius being essentially genuine, but the speeches given in\\nthe senate on the occasion of the Catilinarian conspiracy are very\\ndifferent from the same orations as they appear in Cicero.  Livy makes\\nhis ancient Romans wrangle and chop logic with all the subtlety of a\\nHortensius or a Scævola.  And even in later days, when shorthand\\nreporters attended the debates of the senate and a _Daily News_ was\\npublished in Rome, we find that one of the most celebrated speeches in\\nTacitus (that in which the Emperor Claudius gives the Gauls their\\nfreedom) is shown, by an inscription discovered recently at Lugdunum, to\\nbe entirely fabulous.\\n\\nUpon the other hand, it must be borne in mind that these speeches were\\nnot intended to deceive; they were regarded merely as a certain dramatic\\nelement which it was allowable to introduce into history for the purpose\\nof giving more life and reality to the narration, and were to be\\ncriticised, not as we should, by arguing how in an age before shorthand\\nwas known such a report was possible or how, in the failure of written\\ndocuments, tradition could bring down such an accurate verbal account,\\nbut by the higher test of their psychological probability as regards the\\npersons in whose mouths they are placed.  An ancient historian in answer\\nto modern criticism would say, probably, that these fictitious speeches\\nwere in reality more truthful than the actual ones, just as Aristotle\\nclaimed for poetry a higher degree of truth in comparison to history.\\nThe whole point is interesting as showing how far in advance of his age\\nPolybius may be said to have been.\\n\\nThe last scientific historian, it is possible to gather from his writings\\nwhat he considered were the characteristics of the ideal writer of\\nhistory; and no small light will be thrown on the progress of historical\\ncriticism if we strive to collect and analyse what in Polybius are more\\nor less scattered expressions.  The ideal historian must be contemporary\\nwith the events he describes, or removed from them by one generation\\nonly.  Where it is possible, he is to be an eye-witness of what he writes\\nof; where that is out of his power he is to test all traditions and\\nstories carefully and not to be ready to accept what is plausible in\\nplace of what is true.  He is to be no bookworm living aloof from the\\nexperiences of the world in the artificial isolation of a university\\ntown, but a politician, a soldier, and a traveller, a man not merely of\\nthought but of action, one who can do great things as well as write of\\nthem, who in the sphere of history could be what Byron and Æschylus were\\nin the sphere of poetry, at once _le chantre et le héros_.\\n\\nHe is to keep before his eyes the fact that chance is merely a synonym\\nfor our ignorance; that the reign of law pervades the domain of history\\nas much as it does that of political science.  He is to accustom himself\\nto look on all occasions for rational and natural causes.  And while he\\nis to recognise the practical utility of the supernatural, in an\\neducational point of view, he is not himself to indulge in such\\nintellectual beating of the air as to admit the possibility of the\\nviolation of inviolable laws, or to argue in a sphere wherein argument is\\n_a priori_ annihilated.  He is to be free from all bias towards friend\\nand country; he is to be courteous and gentle in criticism; he is not to\\nregard history as a mere opportunity for splendid and tragic writing; nor\\nis he to falsify truth for the sake of a paradox or an epigram.\\n\\nWhile acknowledging the importance of particular facts as samples of\\nhigher truths, he is to take a broad and general view of humanity.  He is\\nto deal with the whole race and with the world, not with particular\\ntribes or separate countries.  He is to bear in mind that the world is\\nreally an organism wherein no one part can be moved without the others\\nbeing affected also.  He is to distinguish between cause and occasion,\\nbetween the influence of general laws and particular fancies, and he is\\nto remember that the greatest lessons of the world are contained in\\nhistory and that it is the historian’s duty to manifest them so as to\\nsave nations from following those unwise policies which always lead to\\ndishonour and ruin, and to teach individuals to apprehend by the\\nintellectual culture of history those truths which else they would have\\nto learn in the bitter school of experience.\\n\\nNow, as regards his theory of the necessity of the historian’s being\\ncontemporary with the events he describes, so far as the historian is a\\nmere narrator the remark is undoubtedly true.  But to appreciate the\\nharmony and rational position of the facts of a great epoch, to discover\\nits laws, the causes which produced it and the effects which it\\ngenerates, the scene must be viewed from a certain height and distance to\\nbe completely apprehended.  A thoroughly contemporary historian such as\\nLord Clarendon or Thucydides is in reality part of the history he\\ncriticises; and, in the case of such contemporary historians as Fabius\\nand Philistus, Polybius in compelled to acknowledge that they are misled\\nby patriotic and other considerations.  Against Polybius himself no such\\naccusation can be made.  He indeed of all men is able, as from some lofty\\ntower, to discern the whole tendency of the ancient world, the triumph of\\nRoman institutions and of Greek thought which is the last message of the\\nold world and, in a more spiritual sense, has become the Gospel of the\\nnew.\\n\\nOne thing indeed he did not see, or if he saw it, he thought but little\\nof it—how from the East there was spreading over the world, as a wave\\nspreads, a spiritual inroad of new religions from the time when the\\nPessinuntine mother of the gods, a shapeless mass of stone, was brought\\nto the eternal city by her holiest citizen, to the day when the ship\\n_Castor and Pollux_ stood in at Puteoli, and St. Paul turned his face\\ntowards martyrdom and victory at Rome.  Polybius was able to predict,\\nfrom his knowledge of the causes of revolutions and the tendencies of the\\nvarious forms of governments, the uprising of that democratic tone of\\nthought which, as soon as a seed is sown in the murder of the Gracchi and\\nthe exile of Marius, culminated as all democratic movements do culminate,\\nin the supreme authority of one man, the lordship of the world under the\\nworld’s rightful lord, Caius Julius Cæsar.  This, indeed, he saw in no\\nuncertain way.  But the turning of all men’s hearts to the East, the\\nfirst glimmering of that splendid dawn which broke over the hills of\\nGalilee and flooded the earth like wine, was hidden from his eyes.\\n\\nThere are many points in the description of the ideal historian which one\\nmay compare to the picture which Plato has given us of the ideal\\nphilosopher.  They are both ‘spectators of all time and all existence.’\\nNothing is contemptible in their eyes, for all things have a meaning, and\\nthey both walk in august reasonableness before all men, conscious of the\\nworkings of God yet free from all terror of mendicant priest or vagrant\\nmiracle-worker.  But the parallel ends here.  For the one stands aloof\\nfrom the world-storm of sleet and hail, his eyes fixed on distant and\\nsunlit heights, loving knowledge for the sake of knowledge and wisdom for\\nthe joy of wisdom, while the other is an eager actor in the world ever\\nseeking to apply his knowledge to useful things.  Both equally desire\\ntruth, but the one because of its utility, the other for its beauty.  The\\nhistorian regards it as the rational principle of all true history, and\\nno more.  To the other it comes as an all-pervading and mystic\\nenthusiasm, ‘like the desire of strong wine, the craving of ambition, the\\npassionate love of what is beautiful.’\\n\\nStill, though we miss in the historian those higher and more spiritual\\nqualities which the philosopher of the Academe alone of all men\\npossessed, we must not blind ourselves to the merits of that great\\nrationalist who seems to have anticipated the very latest words of modern\\nscience.  Nor yet is he to be regarded merely in the narrow light in\\nwhich he is estimated by most modern critics, as the explicit champion of\\nrationalism and nothing more.  For he is connected with another idea, the\\ncourse of which is as the course of that great river of his native\\nArcadia which, springing from some arid and sun-bleached rock, gathers\\nstrength and beauty as it flows till it reaches the asphodel meadows of\\nOlympia and the light and laughter of Ionian waters.\\n\\nFor in him we can discern the first notes of that great cult of the\\nseven-hilled city which made Virgil write his epic and Livy his history,\\nwhich found in Dante its highest exponent, which dreamed of an Empire\\nwhere the Emperor would care for the bodies and the Pope for the souls of\\nmen, and so has passed into the conception of God’s spiritual empire and\\nthe universal brotherhood of man and widened into the huge ocean of\\nuniversal thought as the Peneus loses itself in the sea.\\n\\nPolybius is the last scientific historian of Greece.  The writer who\\nseems fittingly to complete the progress of thought is a writer of\\nbiographies only.  I will not here touch on Plutarch’s employment of the\\ninductive method as shown in his constant use of inscription and statue,\\nof public document and building and the like, because it involves no new\\nmethod.  It is his attitude towards miracles of which I desire to treat.\\n\\nPlutarch is philosophic enough to see that in the sense of a violation of\\nthe laws of nature a miracle is impossible.  It is absurd, he says, to\\nimagine that the statue of a saint can speak, and that an inanimate\\nobject not possessing the vocal organs should be able to utter an\\narticulate sound.  Upon the other hand, he protests against science\\nimagining that, by explaining the natural causes of things, it has\\nexplained away their transcendental meaning.  ‘When the tears on the\\ncheek of some holy statue have been analysed into the moisture which\\ncertain temperatures produce on wood and marble, it yet by no means\\nfollows that they were not a sign of grief and mourning set there by God\\nHimself.’  When Lampon saw in the prodigy of the one-horned ram the omen\\nof the supreme rule of Pericles, and when Anaxagoras showed that the\\nabnormal development was the rational resultant of the peculiar formation\\nof the skull, the dreamer and the man of science were both right; it was\\nthe business of the latter to consider how the prodigy came about, of the\\nformer to show why it was so formed and what it so portended.  The\\nprogression of thought is exemplified in all particulars.  Herodotus had\\na glimmering sense of the impossibility of a violation of nature.\\nThucydides ignored the supernatural.  Polybius rationalised it.  Plutarch\\nraises it to its mystical heights again, though he bases it on law.  In a\\nword, Plutarch felt that while science brings the supernatural down to\\nthe natural, yet ultimately all that is natural is really supernatural.\\nTo him, as to many of our own day, religion was that transcendental\\nattitude of the mind which, contemplating a world resting on inviolable\\nlaw, is yet comforted and seeks to worship God not in the violation but\\nin the fulfilment of nature.\\n\\nIt may seem paradoxical to quote in connection with the priest of\\nChæronea such a pure rationalist as Mr. Herbert Spencer; yet when we read\\nas the last message of modern science that ‘when the equation of life has\\nbeen reduced to its lowest terms the symbols are symbols still,’ mere\\nsigns, that is, of that unknown reality which underlies all matter and\\nall spirit, we may feel how over the wide strait of centuries thought\\ncalls to thought and how Plutarch has a higher position than is usually\\nclaimed for him in the progress of the Greek intellect.\\n\\nAnd, indeed, it seems that not merely the importance of Plutarch himself\\nbut also that of the land of his birth in the evolution of Greek\\ncivilisation has been passed over by modern critics.  To us, indeed, the\\nbare rock to which the Parthenon serves as a crown, and which lies\\nbetween Colonus and Attica’s violet hills, will always be the holiest\\nspot in the land of Greece: and Delphi will come next, and then the\\nmeadows of Eurotas where that noble people lived who represented in\\nHellenic thought the reaction of the law of duty against the law of\\nbeauty, the opposition of conduct to culture.  Yet, as one stands on the\\n_σχιστὴ ὁδός_ of Cithæron and looks out on the great double plain of\\nBoeotia, the enormous importance of the division of Hellas comes to one’s\\nmind with great force.  To the north are Orchomenus and the Minyan\\ntreasure-house, seat of those merchant princes of Phoenicia who brought\\nto Greece the knowledge of letters and the art of working in gold.\\nThebes is at our feet with the gloom of the terrible legends of Greek\\ntragedy still lingering about it, the birthplace of Pindar, the nurse of\\nEpaminondas and the Sacred Band.\\n\\nAnd from out of the plain where ‘Mars loved to dance,’ rises the Muses’\\nhaunt, Helicon, by whose silver streams Corinna and Hesiod sang; while\\nfar away under the white ægis of those snow-capped mountains lies\\nChæronea and the Lion plain where with vain chivalry the Greeks strove to\\ncheck Macedon first and afterwards Rome; Chæronea, where in the Martinmas\\nsummer of Greek civilisation Plutarch rose from the drear waste of a\\ndying religion as the aftermath rises when the mowers think they have\\nleft the field bare.\\n\\nGreek philosophy began and ended in scepticism: the first and the last\\nword of Greek history was Faith.\\n\\nSplendid thus in its death, like winter sunsets, the Greek religion\\npassed away into the horror of night.  For the Cimmerian darkness was at\\nhand, and when the schools of Athens were closed and the statue of Athena\\nbroken, the Greek spirit passed from the gods and the history of its own\\nland to the subtleties of defining the doctrine of the Trinity and the\\nmystical attempts to bring Plato into harmony with Christ and to\\nreconcile Gethsemane and the Sermon on the Mount with the Athenian prison\\nand the discussion in the woods of Colonus.  The Greek spirit slept for\\nwellnigh a thousand years.  When it woke again, like Antæus it had\\ngathered strength from the earth where it lay; like Apollo it had lost\\nnone of its divinity through its long servitude.\\n\\nIn the history of Roman thought we nowhere find any of those\\ncharacteristics of the Greek Illumination which I have pointed out are\\nthe necessary concomitants of the rise of historical criticism.  The\\nconservative respect for tradition which made the Roman people delight in\\nthe ritual and formulas of law, and is as apparent in their politics as\\nin their religion, was fatal to any rise of that spirit of revolt against\\nauthority the importance of which, as a factor in intellectual progress,\\nwe have already seen.\\n\\nThe whitened tables of the Pontifices preserved carefully the records of\\nthe eclipses and other atmospherical phenomena, and what we call the art\\nof verifying dates was known to them at an early time; but there was no\\nspontaneous rise of physical science to suggest by its analogies of law\\nand order a new method of research, nor any natural springing up of the\\nquestioning spirit of philosophy with its unification of all phenomena\\nand all knowledge.  At the very time when the whole tide of Eastern\\nsuperstition was sweeping into the heart of the Capital the Senate\\nbanished the Greek philosophers from Rome.  And of the three systems\\nwhich did at length take some root in the city, those of Zeno and\\nEpicurus were used merely as the rule for the ordering of life, while the\\ndogmatic scepticism of Carneades, by its very principles, annihilated the\\npossibility of argument and encouraged a perfect indifference to\\nresearch.\\n\\nNor were the Romans ever fortunate enough like the Greeks to have to face\\nthe incubus of any dogmatic system of legends and myths, the immoralities\\nand absurdities of which might excite a revolutionary outbreak of\\nsceptical criticism.  For the Roman religion became as it were\\ncrystallised and isolated from progress at an early period of its\\nevolution.  Their gods remained mere abstractions of commonplace virtues\\nor uninteresting personifications of the useful things of life.  The old\\nprimitive creed was indeed always upheld as a state institution on\\naccount of the enormous facilities it offered for cheating in politics,\\nbut as a spiritual system of belief it was unanimously rejected at a very\\nearly period both by the common people and the educated classes, for the\\nsensible reason that it was so extremely dull.  The former took refuge in\\nthe mystic sensualities of the worship of Isis, the latter in the Stoical\\nrules of life.  The Romans classified their gods carefully in their order\\nof precedence, analysed their genealogies in the laborious spirit of\\nmodern heraldry, fenced them round with a ritual as intricate as their\\nlaw, but never quite cared enough about them to believe in them.  So it\\nwas of no account with them when the philosophers announced that Minerva\\nwas merely memory.  She had never been much else.  Nor did they protest\\nwhen Lucretius dared to say of Ceres and of Liber that they were only the\\ncorn of the field and the fruit of the vine.  For they had never mourned\\nfor the daughter of Demeter in the asphodel meadows of Sicily, nor\\ntraversed the glades of Cithæron with fawn-skin and with spear.\\n\\nThis brief sketch of the condition of Roman thought will serve to prepare\\nus for the almost total want of scientific historical criticism which we\\nshall discern in their literature, and has, besides, afforded fresh\\ncorroboration of the conditions essential to the rise of this spirit, and\\nof the modes of thought which it reflects and in which it is always to be\\nfound.  Roman historical composition had its origin in the pontifical\\ncollege of ecclesiastical lawyers, and preserved to its close the\\nuncritical spirit which characterised its fountain-head.  It possessed\\nfrom the outset a most voluminous collection of the materials of history,\\nwhich, however, produced merely antiquarians, not historians.  It is so\\nhard to use facts, so easy to accumulate them.\\n\\nWearied of the dull monotony of the pontifical annals, which dwelt on\\nlittle else but the rise and fall in provisions and the eclipses of the\\nsun, Cato wrote out a history with his own hand for the instruction of\\nhis child, to which he gave the name of Origines, and before his time\\nsome aristocratic families had written histories in Greek much in the\\nsame spirit in which the Germans of the eighteenth century used French as\\nthe literary language.  But the first regular Roman historian is Sallust.\\nBetween the extravagant eulogies passed on this author by the French\\n(such as De Closset), and Dr. Mommsen’s view of him as merely a political\\npamphleteer, it is perhaps difficult to reach the _via media_ of\\nunbiassed appreciation.  He has, at any rate, the credit of being a\\npurely rationalistic historian, perhaps the only one in Roman literature.\\nCicero had a good many qualifications for a scientific historian, and (as\\nhe usually did) thought very highly of his own powers.  On passages of\\nancient legend, however, he is rather unsatisfactory, for while he is too\\nsensible to believe them he is too patriotic to reject them.  And this is\\nreally the attitude of Livy, who claims for early Roman legend a certain\\nuncritical homage from the rest of the subject world.  His view in his\\nhistory is that it is not worth while to examine the truth of these\\nstories.\\n\\nIn his hands the history of Rome unrolls before our eyes like some\\ngorgeous tapestry, where victory succeeds victory, where triumph treads\\non the heels of triumph, and the line of heroes seems never to end.  It\\nis not till we pass behind the canvas and see the slight means by which\\nthe effect is produced that we apprehend the fact that like most\\npicturesque writers Livy is an indifferent critic.  As regards his\\nattitude towards the credibility of early Roman history he is quite as\\nconscious as we are of its mythical and unsound nature.  He will not, for\\ninstance, decide whether the Horatii were Albans or Romans; who was the\\nfirst dictator; how many tribunes there were, and the like.  His method,\\nas a rule, is merely to mention all the accounts and sometimes to decide\\nin favour of the most probable, but usually not to decide at all.  No\\ncanons of historical criticism will ever discover whether the Roman women\\ninterviewed the mother of Coriolanus of their own accord or at the\\nsuggestion of the senate; whether Remus was killed for jumping over his\\nbrother’s wall or because they quarrelled about birds; whether the\\nambassadors found Cincinnatus ploughing or only mending a hedge.  Livy\\nsuspends his judgment over these important facts and history when\\nquestioned on their truth is dumb.  If he does select between two\\nhistorians he chooses the one who is nearer to the facts he describes.\\nBut he is no critic, only a conscientious writer.  It is mere vain waste\\nto dwell on his critical powers, for they do not exist.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nIn the case of Tacitus imagination has taken the place of history.  The\\npast lives again in his pages, but through no laborious criticism; rather\\nthrough a dramatic and psychological faculty which he specially\\npossessed.\\n\\nIn the philosophy of history he has no belief.  He can never make up his\\nmind what to believe as regards God’s government of the world.  There is\\nno method in him and none elsewhere in Roman literature.\\n\\nNations may not have missions but they certainly have functions.  And the\\nfunction of ancient Italy was not merely to give us what is statical in\\nour institutions and rational in our law, but to blend into one elemental\\ncreed the spiritual aspirations of Aryan and of Semite.  Italy was not a\\npioneer in intellectual progress, nor a motive power in the evolution of\\nthought.  The owl of the goddess of Wisdom traversed over the whole land\\nand found nowhere a resting-place.  The dove, which is the bird of\\nChrist, flew straight to the city of Rome and the new reign began.  It\\nwas the fashion of early Italian painters to represent in mediæval\\ncostume the soldiers who watched over the tomb of Christ, and this, which\\nwas the result of the frank anachronism of all true art, may serve to us\\nas an allegory.  For it was in vain that the Middle Ages strove to guard\\nthe buried spirit of progress.  When the dawn of the Greek spirit arose,\\nthe sepulchre was empty, the grave-clothes laid aside.  Humanity had\\nrisen from the dead.\\n\\nThe study of Greek, it has been well said, implies the birth of\\ncriticism, comparison and research.  At the opening of that education of\\nmodern by ancient thought which we call the Renaissance, it was the words\\nof Aristotle which sent Columbus sailing to the New World, while a\\nfragment of Pythagorean astronomy set Copernicus thinking on that train\\nof reasoning which has revolutionised the whole position of our planet in\\nthe universe.  Then it was seen that the only meaning of progress is a\\nreturn to Greek modes of thought.  The monkish hymns which obscured the\\npages of Greek manuscripts were blotted out, the splendours of a new\\nmethod were unfolded to the world, and out of the melancholy sea of\\nmediævalism rose the free spirit of man in all that splendour of glad\\nadolescence, when the bodily powers seem quickened by a new vitality,\\nwhen the eye sees more clearly than its wont and the mind apprehends what\\nwas beforetime hidden from it.  To herald the opening of the sixteenth\\ncentury, from the little Venetian printing press came forth all the great\\nauthors of antiquity, each bearing on the title-page the words _Ἅλδος ὁ\\nΜανούτιος Ῥωμαῖος καὶ Φιλέλλην_; words which may serve to remind us with\\nwhat wondrous prescience Polybius saw the world’s fate when he foretold\\nthe material sovereignty of Roman institutions and exemplified in himself\\nthe intellectual empire of Greece.\\n\\nThe course of the study of the spirit of historical criticism has not\\nbeen a profitless investigation into modes and forms of thought now\\nantiquated and of no account.  The only spirit which is entirely removed\\nfrom us is the mediæval; the Greek spirit is essentially modern.  The\\nintroduction of the comparative method of research which has forced\\nhistory to disclose its secrets belongs in a measure to us.  Ours, too,\\nis a more scientific knowledge of philology and the method of survival.\\nNor did the ancients know anything of the doctrine of averages or of\\ncrucial instances, both of which methods have proved of such importance\\nin modern criticism, the one adding a most important proof of the\\nstatical elements of history, and exemplifying the influences of all\\nphysical surroundings on the life of man; the other, as in the single\\ninstance of the Moulin Quignon skull, serving to create a whole new\\nscience of prehistoric archæology and to bring us back to a time when man\\nwas coeval with the stone age, the mammoth and the woolly rhinoceros.\\nBut, except these, we have added no new canon or method to the science of\\nhistorical criticism.  Across the drear waste of a thousand years the\\nGreek and the modern spirit join hands.\\n\\nIn the torch race which the Greek boys ran from the Cerameician field of\\ndeath to the home of the goddess of Wisdom, not merely he who first\\nreached the goal but he also who first started with the torch aflame\\nreceived a prize.  In the Lampadephoria of civilisation and free thought\\nlet us not forget to render due meed of honour to those who first lit\\nthat sacred flame, the increasing splendour of which lights our footsteps\\nto the far-off divine event of the attainment of perfect truth.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ENGLISH RENAISSANCE OF ART\\n\\n\\n‘The English Renaissance of Art’ was delivered as a lecture for the first\\ntime in the Chickering Hall, New York, on January 9, 1882.  A portion of\\nit was reported in the _New York Tribune_ on the following day and in\\nother American papers subsequently.  Since then this portion has been\\nreprinted, more or less accurately, from time to time, in unauthorised\\neditions.\\n\\nThere are in existence no less than four copies of the lecture, the\\nearliest of which is entirely in the author’s handwriting.  The others\\nare type-written and contain many corrections and additions made by the\\nauthor in manuscript.  These have all been collated and the text here\\ngiven contains, as nearly as possible, the lecture in the original form\\nas delivered by the author during his tour in the United States.\\n\\nAMONG the many debts which we owe to the supreme æsthetic faculty of\\nGoethe is that he was the first to teach us to define beauty in terms the\\nmost concrete possible, to realise it, I mean, always in its special\\nmanifestations.  So, in the lecture which I have the honour to deliver\\nbefore you, I will not try to give you any abstract definition of\\nbeauty—any such universal formula for it as was sought for by the\\nphilosophy of the eighteenth century—still less to communicate to you\\nthat which in its essence is incommunicable, the virtue by which a\\nparticular picture or poem affects us with a unique and special joy; but\\nrather to point out to you the general ideas which characterise the great\\nEnglish Renaissance of Art in this century, to discover their source, as\\nfar as that is possible, and to estimate their future as far as that is\\npossible.\\n\\nI call it our English Renaissance because it is indeed a sort of new\\nbirth of the spirit of man, like the great Italian Renaissance of the\\nfifteenth century, in its desire for a more gracious and comely way of\\nlife, its passion for physical beauty, its exclusive attention to form,\\nits seeking for new subjects for poetry, new forms of art, new\\nintellectual and imaginative enjoyments: and I call it our romantic\\nmovement because it is our most recent expression of beauty.\\n\\nIt has been described as a mere revival of Greek modes of thought, and\\nagain as a mere revival of mediæval feeling.  Rather I would say that to\\nthese forms of the human spirit it has added whatever of artistic value\\nthe intricacy and complexity and experience of modern life can give:\\ntaking from the one its clearness of vision and its sustained calm, from\\nthe other its variety of expression and the mystery of its vision.  For\\nwhat, as Goethe said, is the study of the ancients but a return to the\\nreal world (for that is what they did); and what, said Mazzini, is\\nmediævalism but individuality?\\n\\nIt is really from the union of Hellenism, in its breadth, its sanity of\\npurpose, its calm possession of beauty, with the adventive, the\\nintensified individualism, the passionate colour of the romantic spirit,\\nthat springs the art of the nineteenth century in England, as from the\\nmarriage of Faust and Helen of Troy sprang the beautiful boy Euphorion.\\n\\nSuch expressions as ‘classical’ and ‘romantic’ are, it is true, often apt\\nto become the mere catchwords of schools.  We must always remember that\\nart has only one sentence to utter: there is for her only one high law,\\nthe law of form or harmony—yet between the classical and romantic spirit\\nwe may say that there lies this difference at least, that the one deals\\nwith the type and the other with the exception.  In the work produced\\nunder the modern romantic spirit it is no longer the permanent, the\\nessential truths of life that are treated of; it is the momentary\\nsituation of the one, the momentary aspect of the other that art seeks to\\nrender.  In sculpture, which is the type of one spirit, the subject\\npredominates over the situation; in painting, which is the type of the\\nother, the situation predominates over the subject.\\n\\nThere are two spirits, then: the Hellenic spirit and the spirit of\\nromance may be taken as forming the essential elements of our conscious\\nintellectual tradition, of our permanent standard of taste.  As regards\\ntheir origin, in art as in politics there is but one origin for all\\nrevolutions, a desire on the part of man for a nobler form of life, for a\\nfreer method and opportunity of expression.  Yet, I think that in\\nestimating the sensuous and intellectual spirit which presides over our\\nEnglish Renaissance, any attempt to isolate it in any way from in the\\nprogress and movement and social life of the age that has produced it\\nwould be to rob it of its true vitality, possibly to mistake its true\\nmeaning.  And in disengaging from the pursuits and passions of this\\ncrowded modern world those passions and pursuits which have to do with\\nart and the love of art, we must take into account many great events of\\nhistory which seem to be the most opposed to any such artistic feeling.\\n\\nAlien then from any wild, political passion, or from the harsh voice of a\\nrude people in revolt, as our English Renaissance must seem, in its\\npassionate cult of pure beauty, its flawless devotion to form, its\\nexclusive and sensitive nature, it is to the French Revolution that we\\nmust look for the most primary factor of its production, the first\\ncondition of its birth: that great Revolution of which we are all the\\nchildren though the voices of some of us be often loud against it; that\\nRevolution to which at a time when even such spirits as Coleridge and\\nWordsworth lost heart in England, noble messages of love blown across\\nseas came from your young Republic.\\n\\nIt is true that our modern sense of the continuity of history has shown\\nus that neither in politics nor in nature are there revolutions ever but\\nevolutions only, and that the prelude to that wild storm which swept over\\nFrance in 1789 and made every king in Europe tremble for his throne, was\\nfirst sounded in literature years before the Bastille fell and the Palace\\nwas taken.  The way for those red scenes by Seine and Loire was paved by\\nthat critical spirit of Germany and England which accustomed men to bring\\nall things to the test of reason or utility or both, while the discontent\\nof the people in the streets of Paris was the echo that followed the life\\nof Emile and of Werther.  For Rousseau, by silent lake and mountain, had\\ncalled humanity back to the golden age that still lies before us and\\npreached a return to nature, in passionate eloquence whose music still\\nlingers about our keen northern air.  And Goethe and Scott had brought\\nromance back again from the prison she had lain in for so many\\ncenturies—and what is romance but humanity?\\n\\nYet in the womb of the Revolution itself, and in the storm and terror of\\nthat wild time, tendencies were hidden away that the artistic Renaissance\\nbent to her own service when the time came—a scientific tendency first,\\nwhich has borne in our own day a brood of somewhat noisy Titans, yet in\\nthe sphere of poetry has not been unproductive of good.  I do not mean\\nmerely in its adding to enthusiasm that intellectual basis which in its\\nstrength, or that more obvious influence about which Wordsworth was\\nthinking when he said very nobly that poetry was merely the impassioned\\nexpression in the face of science, and that when science would put on a\\nform of flesh and blood the poet would lend his divine spirit to aid the\\ntransfiguration.  Nor do I dwell much on the great cosmical emotion and\\ndeep pantheism of science to which Shelley has given its first and\\nSwinburne its latest glory of song, but rather on its influence on the\\nartistic spirit in preserving that close observation and the sense of\\nlimitation as well as of clearness of vision which are the\\ncharacteristics of the real artist.\\n\\nThe great and golden rule of art as well as of life, wrote William Blake,\\nis that the more distinct, sharp and defined the boundary line, the more\\nperfect is the work of art; and the less keen and sharp the greater is\\nthe evidence of weak imitation, plagiarism and bungling.  ‘Great\\ninventors in all ages knew this—Michael Angelo and Albert Durer are known\\nby this and by this alone’; and another time he wrote, with all the\\nsimple directness of nineteenth-century prose, ‘to generalise is to be an\\nidiot.’\\n\\nAnd this love of definite conception, this clearness of vision, this\\nartistic sense of limit, is the characteristic of all great work and\\npoetry; of the vision of Homer as of the vision of Dante, of Keats and\\nWilliam Morris as of Chaucer and Theocritus.  It lies at the base of all\\nnoble, realistic and romantic work as opposed to the colourless and empty\\nabstractions of our own eighteenth-century poets and of the classical\\ndramatists of France, or of the vague spiritualities of the German\\nsentimental school: opposed, too, to that spirit of transcendentalism\\nwhich also was root and flower itself of the great Revolution, underlying\\nthe impassioned contemplation of Wordsworth and giving wings and fire to\\nthe eagle-like flight of Shelley, and which in the sphere of philosophy,\\nthough displaced by the materialism and positiveness of our day,\\nbequeathed two great schools of thought, the school of Newman to Oxford,\\nthe school of Emerson to America.  Yet is this spirit of\\ntranscendentalism alien to the spirit of art.  For the artist can accept\\nno sphere of life in exchange for life itself.  For him there is no\\nescape from the bondage of the earth: there is not even the desire of\\nescape.\\n\\nHe is indeed the only true realist: symbolism, which is the essence of\\nthe transcendental spirit, is alien to him.  The metaphysical mind of\\nAsia will create for itself the monstrous, many-breasted idol of Ephesus,\\nbut to the Greek, pure artist, that work is most instinct with spiritual\\nlife which conforms most clearly to the perfect facts of physical life.\\n\\n‘The storm of revolution,’ as Andre Chenier said, ‘blows out the torch of\\npoetry.’  It is not for some little time that the real influence of such\\na wild cataclysm of things is felt: at first the desire for equality\\nseems to have produced personalities of more giant and Titan stature than\\nthe world had ever known before.  Men heard the lyre of Byron and the\\nlegions of Napoleon; it was a period of measureless passions and of\\nmeasureless despair; ambition, discontent, were the chords of life and\\nart; the age was an age of revolt: a phase through which the human spirit\\nmust pass, but one in which it cannot rest.  For the aim of culture is\\nnot rebellion but peace, the valley perilous where ignorant armies clash\\nby night being no dwelling-place meet for her to whom the gods have\\nassigned the fresh uplands and sunny heights and clear, untroubled air.\\n\\nAnd soon that desire for perfection, which lay at the base of the\\nRevolution, found in a young English poet its most complete and flawless\\nrealisation.\\n\\nPhidias and the achievements of Greek art are foreshadowed in Homer:\\nDante prefigures for us the passion and colour and intensity of Italian\\npainting: the modern love of landscape dates from Rousseau, and it is in\\nKeats that one discerns the beginning of the artistic renaissance of\\nEngland.\\n\\nByron was a rebel and Shelley a dreamer; but in the calmness and\\nclearness of his vision, his perfect self-control, his unerring sense of\\nbeauty and his recognition of a separate realm for the imagination, Keats\\nwas the pure and serene artist, the forerunner of the pre-Raphaelite\\nschool, and so of the great romantic movement of which I am to speak.\\n\\nBlake had indeed, before him, claimed for art a lofty, spiritual mission,\\nand had striven to raise design to the ideal level of poetry and music,\\nbut the remoteness of his vision both in painting and poetry and the\\nincompleteness of his technical powers had been adverse to any real\\ninfluence.  It is in Keats that the artistic spirit of this century first\\nfound its absolute incarnation.\\n\\nAnd these pre-Raphaelites, what were they?  If you ask nine-tenths of the\\nBritish public what is the meaning of the word æsthetics, they will tell\\nyou it is the French for affectation or the German for a dado; and if you\\ninquire about the pre-Raphaelites you will hear something about an\\neccentric lot of young men to whom a sort of divine crookedness and holy\\nawkwardness in drawing were the chief objects of art.  To know nothing\\nabout their great men is one of the necessary elements of English\\neducation.\\n\\nAs regards the pre-Raphaelites the story is simple enough.  In the year\\n1847 a number of young men in London, poets and painters, passionate\\nadmirers of Keats all of them, formed the habit of meeting together for\\ndiscussions on art, the result of such discussions being that the English\\nPhilistine public was roused suddenly from its ordinary apathy by hearing\\nthat there was in its midst a body of young men who had determined to\\nrevolutionise English painting and poetry.  They called themselves the\\npre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.\\n\\nIn England, then as now, it was enough for a man to try and produce any\\nserious beautiful work to lose all his rights as a citizen; and besides\\nthis, the pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood—among whom the names of Dante\\nRossetti, Holman Hunt and Millais will be familiar to you—had on their\\nside three things that the English public never forgives: youth, power\\nand enthusiasm.\\n\\nSatire, always as sterile as it in shameful and as impotent as it is\\ninsolent, paid them that usual homage which mediocrity pays to\\ngenius—doing, here as always, infinite harm to the public, blinding them\\nto what is beautiful, teaching them that irreverence which is the source\\nof all vileness and narrowness of life, but harming the artist not at\\nall, rather confirming him in the perfect rightness of his work and\\nambition.  For to disagree with three-fourths of the British public on\\nall points is one of the first elements of sanity, one of the deepest\\nconsolations in all moments of spiritual doubt.\\n\\nAs regards the ideas these young men brought to the regeneration of\\nEnglish art, we may see at the base of their artistic creations a desire\\nfor a deeper spiritual value to be given to art as well as a more\\ndecorative value.\\n\\nPre-Raphaelites they called themselves; not that they imitated the early\\nItalian masters at all, but that in their work, as opposed to the facile\\nabstractions of Raphael, they found a stronger realism of imagination, a\\nmore careful realism of technique, a vision at once more fervent and more\\nvivid, an individuality more intimate and more intense.\\n\\nFor it is not enough that a work of art should conform to the æsthetic\\ndemands of its age: there must be also about it, if it is to affect us\\nwith any permanent delight, the impress of a distinct individuality, an\\nindividuality remote from that of ordinary men, and coming near to us\\nonly by virtue of a certain newness and wonder in the work, and through\\nchannels whose very strangeness makes us more ready to give them welcome.\\n\\n_La personnalité_, said one of the greatest of modern French critics,\\n_voilà ce qui nous sauvera_.\\n\\nBut above all things was it a return to Nature—that formula which seems\\nto suit so many and such diverse movements: they would draw and paint\\nnothing but what they saw, they would try and imagine things as they\\nreally happened.  Later there came to the old house by Blackfriars\\nBridge, where this young brotherhood used to meet and work, two young men\\nfrom Oxford, Edward Burne-Jones and William Morris—the latter\\nsubstituting for the simpler realism of the early days a more exquisite\\nspirit of choice, a more faultless devotion to beauty, a more intense\\nseeking for perfection: a master of all exquisite design and of all\\nspiritual vision.  It is of the school of Florence rather than of that of\\nVenice that he is kinsman, feeling that the close imitation of Nature is\\na disturbing element in imaginative art.  The visible aspect of modern\\nlife disturbs him not; rather is it for him to render eternal all that is\\nbeautiful in Greek, Italian, and Celtic legend.  To Morris we owe poetry\\nwhose perfect precision and clearness of word and vision has not been\\nexcelled in the literature of our country, and by the revival of the\\ndecorative arts he has given to our individualised romantic movement the\\nsocial idea and the social factor also.\\n\\nBut the revolution accomplished by this clique of young men, with\\nRuskin’s faultless and fervent eloquence to help them, was not one of\\nideas merely but of execution, not one of conceptions but of creations.\\n\\nFor the great eras in the history of the development of all the arts have\\nbeen eras not of increased feeling or enthusiasm in feeling for art, but\\nof new technical improvements primarily and specially.  The discovery of\\nmarble quarries in the purple ravines of Pentelicus and on the little\\nlow-lying hills of the island of Paros gave to the Greeks the opportunity\\nfor that intensified vitality of action, that more sensuous and simple\\nhumanism, to which the Egyptian sculptor working laboriously in the hard\\nporphyry and rose-coloured granite of the desert could not attain.  The\\nsplendour of the Venetian school began with the introduction of the new\\noil medium for painting.  The progress in modern music has been due to\\nthe invention of new instruments entirely, and in no way to an increased\\nconsciousness on the part of the musician of any wider social aim.  The\\ncritic may try and trace the deferred resolutions of Beethoven {124} to\\nsome sense of the incompleteness of the modern intellectual spirit, but\\nthe artist would have answered, as one of them did afterwards, ‘Let them\\npick out the fifths and leave us at peace.’\\n\\nAnd so it is in poetry also: all this love of curious French metres like\\nthe Ballade, the Villanelle, the Rondel; all this increased value laid on\\nelaborate alliterations, and on curious words and refrains, such as you\\nwill find in Dante Rossetti and Swinburne, is merely the attempt to\\nperfect flute and viol and trumpet through which the spirit of the age\\nand the lips of the poet may blow the music of their many messages.\\n\\nAnd so it has been with this romantic movement of ours: it is a reaction\\nagainst the empty conventional workmanship, the lax execution of previous\\npoetry and painting, showing itself in the work of such men as Rossetti\\nand Burne-Jones by a far greater splendour of colour, a far more\\nintricate wonder of design than English imaginative art has shown before.\\nIn Rossetti’s poetry and the poetry of Morris, Swinburne and Tennyson a\\nperfect precision and choice of language, a style flawless and fearless,\\na seeking for all sweet and precious melodies and a sustaining\\nconsciousness of the musical value of each word are opposed to that value\\nwhich is merely intellectual.  In this respect they are one with the\\nromantic movement of France of which not the least characteristic note\\nwas struck by Théophile Gautier’s advice to the young poet to read his\\ndictionary every day, as being the only book worth a poet’s reading.\\n\\nWhile, then, the material of workmanship is being thus elaborated and\\ndiscovered to have in itself incommunicable and eternal qualities of its\\nown, qualities entirely satisfying to the poetic sense and not needing\\nfor their æsthetic effect any lofty intellectual vision, any deep\\ncriticism of life or even any passionate human emotion at all, the spirit\\nand the method of the poet’s working—what people call his\\ninspiration—have not escaped the controlling influence of the artistic\\nspirit.  Not that the imagination has lost its wings, but we have\\naccustomed ourselves to count their innumerable pulsations, to estimate\\ntheir limitless strength, to govern their ungovernable freedom.\\n\\nTo the Greeks this problem of the conditions of poetic production, and\\nthe places occupied by either spontaneity or self-consciousness in any\\nartistic work, had a peculiar fascination.  We find it in the mysticism\\nof Plato and in the rationalism of Aristotle.  We find it later in the\\nItalian Renaissance agitating the minds of such men as Leonardo da Vinci.\\nSchiller tried to adjust the balance between form and feeling, and Goethe\\nto estimate the position of self-consciousness in art.  Wordsworth’s\\ndefinition of poetry as ‘emotion remembered in tranquillity’ may be taken\\nas an analysis of one of the stages through which all imaginative work\\nhas to pass; and in Keats’s longing to be ‘able to compose without this\\nfever’ (I quote from one of his letters), his desire to substitute for\\npoetic ardour ‘a more thoughtful and quiet power,’ we may discern the\\nmost important moment in the evolution of that artistic life.  The\\nquestion made an early and strange appearance in your literature too; and\\nI need not remind you how deeply the young poets of the French romantic\\nmovement were excited and stirred by Edgar Allan Poe’s analysis of the\\nworkings of his own imagination in the creating of that supreme\\nimaginative work which we know by the name of _The Raven_.\\n\\nIn the last century, when the intellectual and didactic element had\\nintruded to such an extent into the kingdom which belongs to poetry, it\\nwas against the claims of the understanding that an artist like Goethe\\nhad to protest.  ‘The more incomprehensible to the understanding a poem\\nis the better for it,’ he said once, asserting the complete supremacy of\\nthe imagination in poetry as of reason in prose.  But in this century it\\nis rather against the claims of the emotional faculties, the claims of\\nmere sentiment and feeling, that the artist must react.  The simple\\nutterance of joy is not poetry any more than a mere personal cry of pain,\\nand the real experiences of the artist are always those which do not find\\ntheir direct expression but are gathered up and absorbed into some\\nartistic form which seems, from such real experiences, to be the farthest\\nremoved and the most alien.\\n\\n‘The heart contains passion but the imagination alone contains poetry,’\\nsays Charles Baudelaire.  This too was the lesson that Théophile Gautier,\\nmost subtle of all modern critics, most fascinating of all modern poets,\\nwas never tired of teaching—‘Everybody is affected by a sunrise or a\\nsunset.’  The absolute distinction of the artist is not his capacity to\\nfeel nature so much as his power of rendering it.  The entire\\nsubordination of all intellectual and emotional faculties to the vital\\nand informing poetic principle is the surest sign of the strength of our\\nRenaissance.\\n\\nWe have seen the artistic spirit working, first in the delightful and\\ntechnical sphere of language, the sphere of expression as opposed to\\nsubject, then controlling the imagination of the poet in dealing with his\\nsubject.  And now I would point out to you its operation in the choice of\\nsubject.  The recognition of a separate realm for the artist, a\\nconsciousness of the absolute difference between the world of art and the\\nworld of real fact, between classic grace and absolute reality, forms not\\nmerely the essential element of any æsthetic charm but is the\\ncharacteristic of all great imaginative work and of all great eras of\\nartistic creation—of the age of Phidias as of the age of Michael Angelo,\\nof the age of Sophocles as of the age of Goethe.\\n\\nArt never harms itself by keeping aloof from the social problems of the\\nday: rather, by so doing, it more completely realises for us that which\\nwe desire.  For to most of us the real life is the life we do not lead,\\nand thus, remaining more true to the essence of its own perfection, more\\njealous of its own unattainable beauty, is less likely to forget form in\\nfeeling or to accept the passion of creation as any substitute for the\\nbeauty of the created thing.\\n\\nThe artist is indeed the child of his own age, but the present will not\\nbe to him a whit more real than the past; for, like the philosopher of\\nthe Platonic vision, the poet is the spectator of all time and of all\\nexistence.  For him no form is obsolete, no subject out of date; rather,\\nwhatever of life and passion the world has known, in desert of Judæa or\\nin Arcadian valley, by the rivers of Troy or the rivers of Damascus, in\\nthe crowded and hideous streets of a modern city or by the pleasant ways\\nof Camelot—all lies before him like an open scroll, all is still instinct\\nwith beautiful life.  He will take of it what is salutary for his own\\nspirit, no more; choosing some facts and rejecting others with the calm\\nartistic control of one who is in possession of the secret of beauty.\\n\\nThere is indeed a poetical attitude to be adopted towards all things, but\\nall things are not fit subjects for poetry.  Into the secure and sacred\\nhouse of Beauty the true artist will admit nothing that is harsh or\\ndisturbing, nothing that gives pain, nothing that is debatable, nothing\\nabout which men argue.  He can steep himself, if he wishes, in the\\ndiscussion of all the social problems of his day, poor-laws and local\\ntaxation, free trade and bimetallic currency, and the like; but when he\\nwrites on these subjects it will be, as Milton nobly expressed it, with\\nhis left hand, in prose and not in verse, in a pamphlet and not in a\\nlyric.  This exquisite spirit of artistic choice was not in Byron:\\nWordsworth had it not.  In the work of both these men there is much that\\nwe have to reject, much that does not give us that sense of calm and\\nperfect repose which should be the effect of all fine, imaginative work.\\nBut in Keats it seemed to have been incarnate, and in his lovely _Ode on\\na Grecian Urn_ it found its most secure and faultless expression; in the\\npageant of the _Earthly Paradise_ and the knights and ladies of\\nBurne-Jones it is the one dominant note.\\n\\nIt is to no avail that the Muse of Poetry be called, even by such a\\nclarion note as Whitman’s, to migrate from Greece and Ionia and to\\nplacard REMOVED and TO LET on the rocks of the snowy Parnassus.\\nCalliope’s call is not yet closed, nor are the epics of Asia ended; the\\nSphinx is not yet silent, nor the fountain of Castaly dry.  For art is\\nvery life itself and knows nothing of death; she is absolute truth and\\ntakes no care of fact; she sees (as I remember Mr. Swinburne insisting on\\nat dinner) that Achilles is even now more actual and real than\\nWellington, not merely more noble and interesting as a type and figure\\nbut more positive and real.\\n\\nLiterature must rest always on a principle, and temporal considerations\\nare no principle at all.  For to the poet all times and places are one;\\nthe stuff he deals with is eternal and eternally the same: no theme is\\ninept, no past or present preferable.  The steam whistle will not\\naffright him nor the flutes of Arcadia weary him: for him there is but\\none time, the artistic moment; but one law, the law of form; but one\\nland, the land of Beauty—a land removed indeed from the real world and\\nyet more sensuous because more enduring; calm, yet with that calm which\\ndwells in the faces of the Greek statues, the calm which comes not from\\nthe rejection but from the absorption of passion, the calm which despair\\nand sorrow cannot disturb but intensify only.  And so it comes that he\\nwho seems to stand most remote from his age is he who mirrors it best,\\nbecause he has stripped life of what is accidental and transitory,\\nstripped it of that ‘mist of familiarity which makes life obscure to us.’\\n\\nThose strange, wild-eyed sibyls fixed eternally in the whirlwind of\\necstasy, those mighty-limbed and Titan prophets, labouring with the\\nsecret of the earth and the burden of mystery, that guard and glorify the\\nchapel of Pope Sixtus at Rome—do they not tell us more of the real spirit\\nof the Italian Renaissance, of the dream of Savonarola and of the sin of\\nBorgia, than all the brawling boors and cooking women of Dutch art can\\nteach us of the real spirit of the history of Holland?\\n\\nAnd so in our own day, also, the two most vital tendencies of the\\nnineteenth century—the democratic and pantheistic tendency and the\\ntendency to value life for the sake of art—found their most complete and\\nperfect utterance in the poetry of Shelley and Keats who, to the blind\\neyes of their own time, seemed to be as wanderers in the wilderness,\\npreachers of vague or unreal things.  And I remember once, in talking to\\nMr. Burne-Jones about modern science, his saying to me, ‘the more\\nmaterialistic science becomes, the more angels shall I paint: their wings\\nare my protest in favour of the immortality of the soul.’\\n\\nBut these are the intellectual speculations that underlie art.  Where in\\nthe arts themselves are we to find that breadth of human sympathy which\\nis the condition of all noble work; where in the arts are we to look for\\nwhat Mazzini would call the social ideas as opposed to the merely\\npersonal ideas?  By virtue of what claim do I demand for the artist the\\nlove and loyalty of the men and women of the world?  I think I can answer\\nthat.\\n\\nWhatever spiritual message an artist brings to his aid is a matter for\\nhis own soul.  He may bring judgment like Michael Angelo or peace like\\nAngelico; he may come with mourning like the great Athenian or with mirth\\nlike the singer of Sicily; nor is it for us to do aught but accept his\\nteaching, knowing that we cannot smite the bitter lips of Leopardi into\\nlaughter or burden with our discontent Goethe’s serene calm.  But for\\nwarrant of its truth such message must have the flame of eloquence in the\\nlips that speak it, splendour and glory in the vision that is its\\nwitness, being justified by one thing only—the flawless beauty and\\nperfect form of its expression: this indeed being the social idea, being\\nthe meaning of joy in art.\\n\\nNot laughter where none should laugh, nor the calling of peace where\\nthere is no peace; not in painting the subject ever, but the pictorial\\ncharm only, the wonder of its colour, the satisfying beauty of its\\ndesign.\\n\\nYou have most of you seen, probably, that great masterpiece of Rubens\\nwhich hangs in the gallery of Brussels, that swift and wonderful pageant\\nof horse and rider arrested in its most exquisite and fiery moment when\\nthe winds are caught in crimson banner and the air lit by the gleam of\\narmour and the flash of plume.  Well, that is joy in art, though that\\ngolden hillside be trodden by the wounded feet of Christ and it is for\\nthe death of the Son of Man that that gorgeous cavalcade is passing.\\n\\nBut this restless modern intellectual spirit of ours is not receptive\\nenough of the sensuous element of art; and so the real influence of the\\narts is hidden from many of us: only a few, escaping from the tyranny of\\nthe soul, have learned the secret of those high hours when thought is\\nnot.\\n\\nAnd this indeed is the reason of the influence which Eastern art is\\nhaving on us in Europe, and of the fascination of all Japanese work.\\nWhile the Western world has been laying on art the intolerable burden of\\nits own intellectual doubts and the spiritual tragedy of its own sorrows,\\nthe East has always kept true to art’s primary and pictorial conditions.\\n\\nIn judging of a beautiful statue the æsthetic faculty is absolutely and\\ncompletely gratified by the splendid curves of those marble lips that are\\ndumb to our complaint, the noble modelling of those limbs that are\\npowerless to help us.  In its primary aspect a painting has no more\\nspiritual message or meaning than an exquisite fragment of Venetian glass\\nor a blue tile from the wall of Damascus: it is a beautifully coloured\\nsurface, nothing more.  The channels by which all noble imaginative work\\nin painting should touch, and do touch the soul, are not those of the\\ntruths of life, nor metaphysical truths.  But that pictorial charm which\\ndoes not depend on any literary reminiscence for its effect on the one\\nhand, nor is yet a mere result of communicable technical skill on the\\nother, comes of a certain inventive and creative handling of colour.\\nNearly always in Dutch painting and often in the works of Giorgione or\\nTitian, it is entirely independent of anything definitely poetical in the\\nsubject, a kind of form and choice in workmanship which is itself\\nentirely satisfying, and is (as the Greeks would say) an end in itself.\\n\\nAnd so in poetry too, the real poetical quality, the joy of poetry, comes\\nnever from the subject but from an inventive handling of rhythmical\\nlanguage, from what Keats called the ‘sensuous life of verse.’  The\\nelement of song in the singing accompanied by the profound joy of motion,\\nis so sweet that, while the incomplete lives of ordinary men bring no\\nhealing power with them, the thorn-crown of the poet will blossom into\\nroses for our pleasure; for our delight his despair will gild its own\\nthorns, and his pain, like Adonis, be beautiful in its agony; and when\\nthe poet’s heart breaks it will break in music.\\n\\nAnd health in art—what is that?  It has nothing to do with a sane\\ncriticism of life.  There is more health in Baudelaire than there is in\\n[Kingsley].  Health is the artist’s recognition of the limitations of the\\nform in which he works.  It is the honour and the homage which he gives\\nto the material he uses—whether it be language with its glories, or\\nmarble or pigment with their glories—knowing that the true brotherhood of\\nthe arts consists not in their borrowing one another’s method, but in\\ntheir producing, each of them by its own individual means, each of them\\nby keeping its objective limits, the same unique artistic delight.  The\\ndelight is like that given to us by music—for music is the art in which\\nform and matter are always one, the art whose subject cannot be separated\\nfrom the method of its expression, the art which most completely realises\\nthe artistic ideal, and is the condition to which all the other arts are\\nconstantly aspiring.\\n\\nAnd criticism—what place is that to have in our culture?  Well, I think\\nthat the first duty of an art critic is to hold his tongue at all times,\\nand upon all subjects: _C’est un grand avantage de n’avoir rien fait_,\\n_mais il ne faut pas en abuser_.\\n\\nIt is only through the mystery of creation that one can gain any\\nknowledge of the quality of created things.  You have listened to\\n_Patience_ for a hundred nights and you have heard me for one only.  It\\nwill make, no doubt, that satire more piquant by knowing something about\\nthe subject of it, but you must not judge of æstheticism by the satire of\\nMr. Gilbert.  As little should you judge of the strength and splendour of\\nsun or sea by the dust that dances in the beam, or the bubble that breaks\\non the wave, as take your critic for any sane test of art.  For the\\nartists, like the Greek gods, are revealed only to one another, as\\nEmerson says somewhere; their real value and place time only can show.\\nIn this respect also omnipotence is with the ages.  The true critic\\naddresses not the artist ever but the public only.  His work lies with\\nthem.  Art can never have any other claim but her own perfection: it is\\nfor the critic to create for art the social aim, too, by teaching the\\npeople the spirit in which they are to approach all artistic work, the\\nlove they are to give it, the lesson they are to draw from it.\\n\\nAll these appeals to art to set herself more in harmony with modern\\nprogress and civilisation, and to make herself the mouthpiece for the\\nvoice of humanity, these appeals to art ‘to have a mission,’ are appeals\\nwhich should be made to the public.  The art which has fulfilled the\\nconditions of beauty has fulfilled all conditions: it is for the critic\\nto teach the people how to find in the calm of such art the highest\\nexpression of their own most stormy passions.  ‘I have no reverence,’\\nsaid Keats, ‘for the public, nor for anything in existence but the\\nEternal Being, the memory of great men and the principle of Beauty.’\\n\\nSuch then is the principle which I believe to be guiding and underlying\\nour English Renaissance, a Renaissance many-sided and wonderful,\\nproductive of strong ambitions and lofty personalities, yet for all its\\nsplendid achievements in poetry and in the decorative arts and in\\npainting, for all the increased comeliness and grace of dress, and the\\nfurniture of houses and the like, not complete.  For there can be no\\ngreat sculpture without a beautiful national life, and the commercial\\nspirit of England has killed that; no great drama without a noble\\nnational life, and the commercial spirit of England has killed that too.\\n\\nIt is not that the flawless serenity of marble cannot bear the burden of\\nthe modern intellectual spirit, or become instinct with the fire of\\nromantic passion—the tomb of Duke Lorenzo and the chapel of the Medici\\nshow us that—but it is that, as Théophile Gautier used to say, the\\nvisible world is dead, _le monde visible a disparu_.\\n\\nNor is it again that the novel has killed the play, as some critics would\\npersuade us—the romantic movement of France shows us that.  The work of\\nBalzac and of Hugo grew up side by side together; nay, more, were\\ncomplementary to each other, though neither of them saw it.  While all\\nother forms of poetry may flourish in an ignoble age, the splendid\\nindividualism of the lyrist, fed by its own passion, and lit by its own\\npower, may pass as a pillar of fire as well across the desert as across\\nplaces that are pleasant.  It is none the less glorious though no man\\nfollow it—nay, by the greater sublimity of its loneliness it may be\\nquickened into loftier utterance and intensified into clearer song.  From\\nthe mean squalor of the sordid life that limits him, the dreamer or the\\nidyllist may soar on poesy’s viewless wings, may traverse with fawn-skin\\nand spear the moonlit heights of Cithæron though Faun and Bassarid dance\\nthere no more.  Like Keats he may wander through the old-world forests of\\nLatmos, or stand like Morris on the galley’s deck with the Viking when\\nking and galley have long since passed away.  But the drama is the\\nmeeting-place of art and life; it deals, as Mazzini said, not merely with\\nman, but with social man, with man in his relation to God and to\\nHumanity.  It is the product of a period of great national united energy;\\nit is impossible without a noble public, and belongs to such ages as the\\nage of Elizabeth in London and of Pericles at Athens; it is part of such\\nlofty moral and spiritual ardour as came to Greek after the defeat of the\\nPersian fleet, and to Englishman after the wreck of the Armada of Spain.\\n\\nShelley felt how incomplete our movement was in this respect, and has\\nshown in one great tragedy by what terror and pity he would have purified\\nour age; but in spite of _The Cenci_ the drama is one of the artistic\\nforms through which the genius of the England of this century seeks in\\nvain to find outlet and expression.  He has had no worthy imitators.\\n\\nIt is rather, perhaps, to you that we should turn to complete and perfect\\nthis great movement of ours, for there is something Hellenic in your air\\nand world, something that has a quicker breath of the joy and power of\\nElizabeth’s England about it than our ancient civilisation can give us.\\nFor you, at least, are young; ‘no hungry generations tread you down,’ and\\nthe past does not weary you with the intolerable burden of its memories\\nnor mock you with the ruins of a beauty, the secret of whose creation you\\nhave lost.  That very absence of tradition, which Mr. Ruskin thought\\nwould rob your rivers of their laughter and your flowers of their light,\\nmay be rather the source of your freedom and your strength.\\n\\nTo speak in literature with the perfect rectitude and insouciance of the\\nmovements of animals, and the unimpeachableness of the sentiment of trees\\nin the woods and grass by the roadside, has been defined by one of your\\npoets as a flawless triumph of art.  It is a triumph which you above all\\nnations may be destined to achieve.  For the voices that have their\\ndwelling in sea and mountain are not the chosen music of Liberty only;\\nother messages are there in the wonder of wind-swept height and the\\nmajesty of silent deep—messages that, if you will but listen to them, may\\nyield you the splendour of some new imagination, the marvel of some new\\nbeauty.\\n\\n‘I foresee,’ said Goethe, ‘the dawn of a new literature which all people\\nmay claim as their own, for all have contributed to its foundation.’  If,\\nthen, this is so, and if the materials for a civilisation as great as\\nthat of Europe lie all around you, what profit, you will ask me, will all\\nthis study of our poets and painters be to you?  I might answer that the\\nintellect can be engaged without direct didactic object on an artistic\\nand historical problem; that the demand of the intellect is merely to\\nfeel itself alive; that nothing which has ever interested men or women\\ncan cease to be a fit subject for culture.\\n\\nI might remind you of what all Europe owes to the sorrow of a single\\nFlorentine in exile at Verona, or to the love of Petrarch by that little\\nwell in Southern France; nay, more, how even in this dull, materialistic\\nage the simple expression of an old man’s simple life, passed away from\\nthe clamour of great cities amid the lakes and misty hills of Cumberland,\\nhas opened out for England treasures of new joy compared with which the\\ntreasures of her luxury are as barren as the sea which she has made her\\nhighway, and as bitter as the fire which she would make her slave.\\n\\nBut I think it will bring you something besides this, something that is\\nthe knowledge of real strength in art: not that you should imitate the\\nworks of these men; but their artistic spirit, their artistic attitude, I\\nthink you should absorb that.\\n\\nFor in nations, as in individuals, if the passion for creation be not\\naccompanied by the critical, the æsthetic faculty also, it will be sure\\nto waste its strength aimlessly, failing perhaps in the artistic spirit\\nof choice, or in the mistaking of feeling for form, or in the following\\nof false ideals.\\n\\nFor the various spiritual forms of the imagination have a natural\\naffinity with certain sensuous forms of art—and to discern the qualities\\nof each art, to intensify as well its limitations as its powers of\\nexpression, is one of the aims that culture sets before us.  It is not an\\nincreased moral sense, an increased moral supervision that your\\nliterature needs.  Indeed, one should never talk of a moral or an immoral\\npoem—poems are either well written or badly written, that is all.  And,\\nindeed, any element of morals or implied reference to a standard of good\\nor evil in art is often a sign of a certain incompleteness of vision,\\noften a note of discord in the harmony of an imaginative creation; for\\nall good work aims at a purely artistic effect.  ‘We must be careful,’\\nsaid Goethe, ‘not to be always looking for culture merely in what is\\nobviously moral.  Everything that is great promotes civilisation as soon\\nas we are aware of it.’\\n\\nBut, as in your cities so in your literature, it is a permanent canon and\\nstandard of taste, an increased sensibility to beauty (if I may say so)\\nthat is lacking.  All noble work is not national merely, but universal.\\nThe political independence of a nation must not be confused with any\\nintellectual isolation.  The spiritual freedom, indeed, your own generous\\nlives and liberal air will give you.  From us you will learn the\\nclassical restraint of form.\\n\\nFor all great art is delicate art, roughness having very little to do\\nwith strength, and harshness very little to do with power.  ‘The artist,’\\nas Mr. Swinburne says, ‘must be perfectly articulate.’\\n\\nThis limitation is for the artist perfect freedom: it is at once the\\norigin and the sign of his strength.  So that all the supreme masters of\\nstyle—Dante, Sophocles, Shakespeare—are the supreme masters of spiritual\\nand intellectual vision also.\\n\\nLove art for its own sake, and then all things that you need will be\\nadded to you.\\n\\nThis devotion to beauty and to the creation of beautiful things is the\\ntest of all great civilised nations.  Philosophy may teach us to bear\\nwith equanimity the misfortunes of our neighbours, and science resolve\\nthe moral sense into a secretion of sugar, but art is what makes the life\\nof each citizen a sacrament and not a speculation, art is what makes the\\nlife of the whole race immortal.\\n\\nFor beauty is the only thing that time cannot harm.  Philosophies fall\\naway like sand, and creeds follow one another like the withered leaves of\\nautumn; but what is beautiful is a joy for all seasons and a possession\\nfor all eternity.\\n\\nWars and the clash of armies and the meeting of men in battle by trampled\\nfield or leaguered city, and the rising of nations there must always be.\\nBut I think that art, by creating a common intellectual atmosphere\\nbetween all countries, might—if it could not overshadow the world with\\nthe silver wings of peace—at least make men such brothers that they would\\nnot go out to slay one another for the whim or folly of some king or\\nminister, as they do in Europe.  Fraternity would come no more with the\\nhands of Cain, nor Liberty betray freedom with the kiss of Anarchy; for\\nnational hatreds are always strongest where culture is lowest.\\n\\n‘How could I?’ said Goethe, when reproached for not writing like Korner\\nagainst the French.  ‘How could I, to whom barbarism and culture alone\\nare of importance, hate a nation which is among the most cultivated of\\nthe earth, a nation to which I owe a great part of my own cultivation?’\\n\\nMighty empires, too, there must always be as long as personal ambition\\nand the spirit of the age are one, but art at least is the only empire\\nwhich a nation’s enemies cannot take from her by conquest, but which is\\ntaken by submission only.  The sovereignty of Greece and Rome is not yet\\npassed away, though the gods of the one be dead and the eagles of the\\nother tired.\\n\\nAnd we in our Renaissance are seeking to create a sovereignty that will\\nstill be England’s when her yellow leopards have grown weary of wars and\\nthe rose of her shield is crimsoned no more with the blood of battle; and\\nyou, too, absorbing into the generous heart of a great people this\\npervading artistic spirit, will create for yourselves such riches as you\\nhave never yet created, though your land be a network of railways and\\nyour cities the harbours for the galleys of the world.\\n\\nI know, indeed, that the divine natural prescience of beauty which is the\\ninalienable inheritance of Greek and Italian is not our inheritance.  For\\nsuch an informing and presiding spirit of art to shield us from all harsh\\nand alien influences, we of the Northern races must turn rather to that\\nstrained self-consciousness of our age which, as it is the key-note of\\nall our romantic art, must be the source of all or nearly all our\\nculture.  I mean that intellectual curiosity of the nineteenth century\\nwhich is always looking for the secret of the life that still lingers\\nround old and bygone forms of culture.  It takes from each what is\\nserviceable for the modern spirit—from Athens its wonder without its\\nworship, from Venice its splendour without its sin.  The same spirit is\\nalways analysing its own strength and its own weakness, counting what it\\nowes to East and to West, to the olive-trees of Colonus and to the\\npalm-trees of Lebanon, to Gethsemane and to the garden of Proserpine.\\n\\nAnd yet the truths of art cannot be taught: they are revealed only,\\nrevealed to natures which have made themselves receptive of all beautiful\\nimpressions by the study and worship of all beautiful things.  And hence\\nthe enormous importance given to the decorative arts in our English\\nRenaissance; hence all that marvel of design that comes from the hand of\\nEdward Burne-Jones, all that weaving of tapestry and staining of glass,\\nthat beautiful working in clay and metal and wood which we owe to William\\nMorris, the greatest handicraftsman we have had in England since the\\nfourteenth century.\\n\\nSo, in years to come there will be nothing in any man’s house which has\\nnot given delight to its maker and does not give delight to its user.\\nThe children, like the children of Plato’s perfect city, will grow up ‘in\\na simple atmosphere of all fair things’—I quote from the passage in the\\n_Republic_—‘a simple atmosphere of all fair things, where beauty, which\\nis the spirit of art, will come on eye and ear like a fresh breath of\\nwind that brings health from a clear upland, and insensibly and gradually\\ndraw the child’s soul into harmony with all knowledge and all wisdom, so\\nthat he will love what is beautiful and good, and hate what is evil and\\nugly (for they always go together) long before he knows the reason why;\\nand then when reason comes will kiss her on the cheek as a friend.’\\n\\nThat is what Plato thought decorative art could do for a nation, feeling\\nthat the secret not of philosophy merely but of all gracious existence\\nmight be externally hidden from any one whose youth had been passed in\\nuncomely and vulgar surroundings, and that the beauty of form and colour\\neven, as he says, in the meanest vessels of the house, will find its way\\ninto the inmost places of the soul and lead the boy naturally to look for\\nthat divine harmony of spiritual life of which art was to him the\\nmaterial symbol and warrant.\\n\\nPrelude indeed to all knowledge and all wisdom will this love of\\nbeautiful things be for us; yet there are times when wisdom becomes a\\nburden and knowledge is one with sorrow: for as every body has its shadow\\nso every soul has its scepticism.  In such dread moments of discord and\\ndespair where should we, of this torn and troubled age, turn our steps if\\nnot to that secure house of beauty where there is always a little\\nforgetfulness, always a great joy; to that _città divina_, as the old\\nItalian heresy called it, the divine city where one can stand, though\\nonly for a brief moment, apart from the division and terror of the world\\nand the choice of the world too?\\n\\nThis is that _consolation des arts_ which is the key-note of Gautier’s\\npoetry, the secret of modern life foreshadowed—as indeed what in our\\ncentury is not?—by Goethe.  You remember what he said to the German\\npeople: ‘Only have the courage,’ he said, ‘to give yourselves up to your\\nimpressions, allow yourselves to be delighted, moved, elevated, nay\\ninstructed, inspired for something great.’  The courage to give\\nyourselves up to your impressions: yes, that is the secret of the\\nartistic life—for while art has been defined as an escape from the\\ntyranny of the senses, it is an escape rather from the tyranny of the\\nsoul.  But only to those who worship her above all things does she ever\\nreveal her true treasure: else will she be as powerless to aid you as the\\nmutilated Venus of the Louvre was before the romantic but sceptical\\nnature of Heine.\\n\\nAnd indeed I think it would be impossible to overrate the gain that might\\nfollow if we had about us only what gave pleasure to the maker of it and\\ngives pleasure to its user, that being the simplest of all rules about\\ndecoration.  One thing, at least, I think it would do for us: there is no\\nsurer test of a great country than how near it stands to its own poets;\\nbut between the singers of our day and the workers to whom they would\\nsing there seems to be an ever-widening and dividing chasm, a chasm which\\nslander and mockery cannot traverse, but which is spanned by the luminous\\nwings of love.\\n\\nAnd of such love I think that the abiding presence in our houses of noble\\nimaginative work would be the surest seed and preparation.  I do not mean\\nmerely as regards that direct literary expression of art by which, from\\nthe little red-and-black cruse of oil or wine, a Greek boy could learn of\\nthe lionlike splendour of Achilles, of the strength of Hector and the\\nbeauty of Paris and the wonder of Helen, long before he stood and\\nlistened in crowded market-place or in theatre of marble; or by which an\\nItalian child of the fifteenth century could know of the chastity of\\nLucrece and the death of Camilla from carven doorway and from painted\\nchest.  For the good we get from art is not what we learn from it; it is\\nwhat we become through it.  Its real influence will be in giving the mind\\nthat enthusiasm which is the secret of Hellenism, accustoming it to\\ndemand from art all that art can do in rearranging the facts of common\\nlife for us—whether it be by giving the most spiritual interpretation of\\none’s own moments of highest passion or the most sensuous expression of\\nthose thoughts that are the farthest removed from sense; in accustoming\\nit to love the things of the imagination for their own sake, and to\\ndesire beauty and grace in all things.  For he who does not love art in\\nall things does not love it at all, and he who does not need art in all\\nthings does not need it at all.\\n\\nI will not dwell here on what I am sure has delighted you all in our\\ngreat Gothic cathedrals.  I mean how the artist of that time,\\nhandicraftsman himself in stone or glass, found the best motives for his\\nart, always ready for his hand and always beautiful, in the daily work of\\nthe artificers he saw around him—as in those lovely windows of\\nChartres—where the dyer dips in the vat and the potter sits at the wheel,\\nand the weaver stands at the loom: real manufacturers these, workers with\\nthe hand, and entirely delightful to look at, not like the smug and vapid\\nshopman of our time, who knows nothing of the web or vase he sells,\\nexcept that he is charging you double its value and thinking you a fool\\nfor buying it.  Nor can I but just note, in passing, the immense\\ninfluence the decorative work of Greece and Italy had on its artists, the\\none teaching the sculptor that restraining influence of design which is\\nthe glory of the Parthenon, the other keeping painting always true to its\\nprimary, pictorial condition of noble colour which is the secret of the\\nschool of Venice; for I wish rather, in this lecture at least, to dwell\\non the effect that decorative art has on human life—on its social not its\\npurely artistic effect.\\n\\nThere are two kinds of men in the world, two great creeds, two different\\nforms of natures: men to whom the end of life is action, and men to whom\\nthe end of life is thought.  As regards the latter, who seek for\\nexperience itself and not for the fruits of experience, who must burn\\nalways with one of the passions of this fiery-coloured world, who find\\nlife interesting not for its secret but for its situations, for its\\npulsations and not for its purpose; the passion for beauty engendered by\\nthe decorative arts will be to them more satisfying than any political or\\nreligious enthusiasm, any enthusiasm for humanity, any ecstasy or sorrow\\nfor love.  For art comes to one professing primarily to give nothing but\\nthe highest quality to one’s moments, and for those moments’ sake.  So\\nfar for those to whom the end of life is thought.  As regards the others,\\nwho hold that life is inseparable from labour, to them should this\\nmovement be specially dear: for, if our days are barren without industry,\\nindustry without art is barbarism.\\n\\nHewers of wood and drawers of water there must be always indeed among us.\\nOur modern machinery has not much lightened the labour of man after all:\\nbut at least let the pitcher that stands by the well be beautiful and\\nsurely the labour of the day will be lightened: let the wood be made\\nreceptive of some lovely form, some gracious design, and there will come\\nno longer discontent but joy to the toiler.  For what is decoration but\\nthe worker’s expression of joy in his work?  And not joy merely—that is a\\ngreat thing yet not enough—but that opportunity of expressing his own\\nindividuality which, as it is the essence of all life, is the source of\\nall art.  ‘I have tried,’ I remember William Morris saying to me once, ‘I\\nhave tried to make each of my workers an artist, and when I say an artist\\nI mean a man.’  For the worker then, handicraftsman of whatever kind he\\nis, art is no longer to be a purple robe woven by a slave and thrown over\\nthe whitened body of a leprous king to hide and to adorn the sin of his\\nluxury, but rather the beautiful and noble expression of a life that has\\nin it something beautiful and noble.\\n\\nAnd so you must seek out your workman and give him, as far as possible,\\nthe right surroundings, for remember that the real test and virtue of a\\nworkman is not his earnestness nor his industry even, but his power of\\ndesign merely; and that ‘design is not the offspring of idle fancy: it is\\nthe studied result of accumulative observation and delightful habit.’\\nAll the teaching in the world is of no avail if you do not surround your\\nworkman with happy influences and with beautiful things.  It is\\nimpossible for him to have right ideas about colour unless he sees the\\nlovely colours of Nature unspoiled; impossible for him to supply\\nbeautiful incident and action unless he sees beautiful incident and\\naction in the world about him.\\n\\nFor to cultivate sympathy you must be among living things and thinking\\nabout them, and to cultivate admiration you must be among beautiful\\nthings and looking at them.  ‘The steel of Toledo and the silk of Genoa\\ndid but give strength to oppression and lustre to pride,’ as Mr. Ruskin\\nsays; let it be for you to create an art that is made by the hands of the\\npeople for the joy of the people, to please the hearts of the people,\\ntoo; an art that will be your expression of your delight in life.  There\\nis nothing ‘in common life too mean, in common things too trivial to be\\nennobled by your touch’; nothing in life that art cannot sanctify.\\n\\nYou have heard, I think, a few of you, of two flowers connected with the\\næsthetic movement in England, and said (I assure you, erroneously) to be\\nthe food of some æsthetic young men.  Well, let me tell you that the\\nreason we love the lily and the sunflower, in spite of what Mr. Gilbert\\nmay tell you, is not for any vegetable fashion at all.  It is because\\nthese two lovely flowers are in England the two most perfect models of\\ndesign, the most naturally adapted for decorative art—the gaudy leonine\\nbeauty of the one and the precious loveliness of the other giving to the\\nartist the most entire and perfect joy.  And so with you: let there be no\\nflower in your meadows that does not wreathe its tendrils around your\\npillows, no little leaf in your Titan forests that does not lend its form\\nto design, no curving spray of wild rose or brier that does not live for\\never in carven arch or window or marble, no bird in your air that is not\\ngiving the iridescent wonder of its colour, the exquisite curves of its\\nwings in flight, to make more precious the preciousness of simple\\nadornment.\\n\\nWe spend our days, each one of us, in looking for the secret of life.\\nWell, the secret of life is in art.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHOUSE DECORATION\\n\\n\\nA lecture delivered in America during Wilde’s tour in 1882.  It was\\nannounced as a lecture on ‘The Practical Application of the Principles of\\nÆsthetic Theory to Exterior and Interior House Decoration, With\\nObservations upon Dress and Personal Ornaments.’  The earliest date on\\nwhich it is known to have been given is May 11, 1882.\\n\\nIN my last lecture I gave you something of the history of Art in England.\\nI sought to trace the influence of the French Revolution upon its\\ndevelopment.  I said something of the song of Keats and the school of the\\npre-Raphaelites.  But I do not want to shelter the movement, which I have\\ncalled the English Renaissance, under any palladium however noble, or any\\nname however revered.  The roots of it have, indeed, to be sought for in\\nthings that have long passed away, and not, as some suppose, in the fancy\\nof a few young men—although I am not altogether sure that there is\\nanything much better than the fancy of a few young men.\\n\\nWhen I appeared before you on a previous occasion, I had seen nothing of\\nAmerican art save the Doric columns and Corinthian chimney-pots visible\\non your Broadway and Fifth Avenue.  Since then, I have been through your\\ncountry to some fifty or sixty different cities, I think.  I find that\\nwhat your people need is not so much high imaginative art but that which\\nhallows the vessels of everyday use.  I suppose that the poet will sing\\nand the artist will paint regardless whether the world praises or blames.\\nHe has his own world and is independent of his fellow-men.  But the\\nhandicraftsman is dependent on your pleasure and opinion.  He needs your\\nencouragement and he must have beautiful surroundings.  Your people love\\nart but do not sufficiently honour the handicraftsman.  Of course, those\\nmillionaires who can pillage Europe for their pleasure need have no care\\nto encourage such; but I speak for those whose desire for beautiful\\nthings is larger than their means.  I find that one great trouble all\\nover is that your workmen are not given to noble designs.  You cannot be\\nindifferent to this, because Art is not something which you can take or\\nleave.  It is a necessity of human life.\\n\\nAnd what is the meaning of this beautiful decoration which we call art?\\nIn the first place, it means value to the workman and it means the\\npleasure which he must necessarily take in making a beautiful thing.  The\\nmark of all good art is not that the thing done is done exactly or\\nfinely, for machinery may do as much, but that it is worked out with the\\nhead and the workman’s heart.  I cannot impress the point too frequently\\nthat beautiful and rational designs are necessary in all work.  I did not\\nimagine, until I went into some of your simpler cities, that there was so\\nmuch bad work done.  I found, where I went, bad wall-papers horribly\\ndesigned, and coloured carpets, and that old offender the horse-hair\\nsofa, whose stolid look of indifference is always so depressing.  I found\\nmeaningless chandeliers and machine-made furniture, generally of\\nrosewood, which creaked dismally under the weight of the ubiquitous\\ninterviewer.  I came across the small iron stove which they always\\npersist in decorating with machine-made ornaments, and which is as great\\na bore as a wet day or any other particularly dreadful institution.  When\\nunusual extravagance was indulged in, it was garnished with two funeral\\nurns.\\n\\nIt must always be remembered that what is well and carefully made by an\\nhonest workman, after a rational design, increases in beauty and value as\\nthe years go on.  The old furniture brought over by the Pilgrims, two\\nhundred years ago, which I saw in New England, is just as good and as\\nbeautiful to-day as it was when it first came here.  Now, what you must\\ndo is to bring artists and handicraftsmen together.  Handicraftsmen\\ncannot live, certainly cannot thrive, without such companionship.\\nSeparate these two and you rob art of all spiritual motive.\\n\\nHaving done this, you must place your workman in the midst of beautiful\\nsurroundings.  The artist is not dependent on the visible and the\\ntangible.  He has his visions and his dreams to feed on.  But the workman\\nmust see lovely forms as he goes to his work in the morning and returns\\nat eventide.  And, in connection with this, I want to assure you that\\nnoble and beautiful designs are never the result of idle fancy or\\npurposeless day-dreaming.  They come only as the accumulation of habits\\nof long and delightful observation.  And yet such things may not be\\ntaught.  Right ideas concerning them can certainly be obtained only by\\nthose who have been accustomed to rooms that are beautiful and colours\\nthat are satisfying.\\n\\nPerhaps one of the most difficult things for us to do is to choose a\\nnotable and joyous dress for men.  There would be more joy in life if we\\nwere to accustom ourselves to use all the beautiful colours we can in\\nfashioning our own clothes.  The dress of the future, I think, will use\\ndrapery to a great extent and will abound with joyous colour.  At present\\nwe have lost all nobility of dress and, in doing so, have almost\\nannihilated the modern sculptor.  And, in looking around at the figures\\nwhich adorn our parks, one could almost wish that we had completely\\nkilled the noble art.  To see the frock-coat of the drawing-room done in\\nbronze, or the double waistcoat perpetuated in marble, adds a new horror\\nto death.  But indeed, in looking through the history of costume, seeking\\nan answer to the questions we have propounded, there is little that is\\neither beautiful or appropriate.  One of the earliest forms is the Greek\\ndrapery which is exquisite for young girls.  And then, I think we may be\\npardoned a little enthusiasm over the dress of the time of Charles I., so\\nbeautiful indeed, that in spite of its invention being with the Cavaliers\\nit was copied by the Puritans.  And the dress for the children of that\\ntime must not be passed over.  It was a very golden age of the little\\nones.  I do not think that they have ever looked so lovely as they do in\\nthe pictures of that time.  The dress of the last century in England is\\nalso peculiarly gracious and graceful.  There is nothing bizarre or\\nstrange about it, but it is full of harmony and beauty.  In these days,\\nwhen we have suffered dreadfully from the incursions of the modern\\nmilliner, we hear ladies boast that they do not wear a dress more than\\nonce.  In the old days, when the dresses were decorated with beautiful\\ndesigns and worked with exquisite embroidery, ladies rather took a pride\\nin bringing out the garment and wearing it many times and handing it down\\nto their daughters—a process that would, I think, be quite appreciated by\\na modern husband when called upon to settle his wife’s bills.\\n\\nAnd how shall men dress?  Men say that they do not particularly care how\\nthey dress, and that it is little matter.  I am bound to reply that I do\\nnot think that you do.  In all my journeys through the country, the only\\nwell-dressed men that I saw—and in saying this I earnestly deprecate the\\npolished indignation of your Fifth Avenue dandies—were the Western\\nminers.  Their wide-brimmed hats, which shaded their faces from the sun\\nand protected them from the rain, and the cloak, which is by far the most\\nbeautiful piece of drapery ever invented, may well be dwelt on with\\nadmiration.  Their high boots, too, were sensible and practical.  They\\nwore only what was comfortable, and therefore beautiful.  As I looked at\\nthem I could not help thinking with regret of the time when these\\npicturesque miners would have made their fortunes and would go East to\\nassume again all the abominations of modern fashionable attire.  Indeed,\\nso concerned was I that I made some of them promise that when they again\\nappeared in the more crowded scenes of Eastern civilisation they would\\nstill continue to wear their lovely costume.  But I do not believe they\\nwill.\\n\\nNow, what America wants to-day is a school of rational art.  Bad art is a\\ngreat deal worse than no art at all.  You must show your workmen\\nspecimens of good work so that they come to know what is simple and true\\nand beautiful.  To that end I would have you have a museum attached to\\nthese schools—not one of those dreadful modern institutions where there\\nis a stuffed and very dusty giraffe, and a case or two of fossils, but a\\nplace where there are gathered examples of art decoration from various\\nperiods and countries.  Such a place is the South Kensington Museum in\\nLondon, whereon we build greater hopes for the future than on any other\\none thing.  There I go every Saturday night, when the museum is open\\nlater than usual, to see the handicraftsman, the wood-worker, the\\nglass-blower and the worker in metals.  And it is here that the man of\\nrefinement and culture comes face to face with the workman who ministers\\nto his joy.  He comes to know more of the nobility of the workman, and\\nthe workman, feeling the appreciation, comes to know more of the nobility\\nof his work.\\n\\nYou have too many white walls.  More colour is wanted.  You should have\\nsuch men as Whistler among you to teach you the beauty and joy of colour.\\nTake Mr. Whistler’s ‘Symphony in White,’ which you no doubt have imagined\\nto be something quite bizarre.  It is nothing of the sort.  Think of a\\ncool grey sky flecked here and there with white clouds, a grey ocean and\\nthree wonderfully beautiful figures robed in white, leaning over the\\nwater and dropping white flowers from their fingers.  Here is no\\nextensive intellectual scheme to trouble you, and no metaphysics of which\\nwe have had quite enough in art.  But if the simple and unaided colour\\nstrike the right key-note, the whole conception is made clear.  I regard\\nMr. Whistler’s famous Peacock Room as the finest thing in colour and art\\ndecoration which the world has known since Correggio painted that\\nwonderful room in Italy where the little children are dancing on the\\nwalls.  Mr. Whistler finished another room just before I came away—a\\nbreakfast room in blue and yellow.  The ceiling was a light blue, the\\ncabinet-work and the furniture were of a yellow wood, the curtains at the\\nwindows were white and worked in yellow, and when the table was set for\\nbreakfast with dainty blue china nothing can be conceived at once so\\nsimple and so joyous.\\n\\nThe fault which I have observed in most of your rooms is that there is\\napparent no definite scheme of colour.  Everything is not attuned to a\\nkey-note as it should be.  The apartments are crowded with pretty things\\nwhich have no relation to one another.  Again, your artists must decorate\\nwhat is more simply useful.  In your art schools I found no attempt to\\ndecorate such things as the vessels for water.  I know of nothing uglier\\nthan the ordinary jug or pitcher.  A museum could be filled with the\\ndifferent kinds of water vessels which are used in hot countries.  Yet we\\ncontinue to submit to the depressing jug with the handle all on one side.\\nI do not see the wisdom of decorating dinner-plates with sunsets and\\nsoup-plates with moonlight scenes.  I do not think it adds anything to\\nthe pleasure of the canvas-back duck to take it out of such glories.\\nBesides, we do not want a soup-plate whose bottom seems to vanish in the\\ndistance.  One feels neither safe nor comfortable under such conditions.\\nIn fact, I did not find in the art schools of the country that the\\ndifference was explained between decorative and imaginative art.\\n\\nThe conditions of art should be simple.  A great deal more depends upon\\nthe heart than upon the head.  Appreciation of art is not secured by any\\nelaborate scheme of learning.  Art requires a good healthy atmosphere.\\nThe motives for art are still around about us as they were round about\\nthe ancients.  And the subjects are also easily found by the earnest\\nsculptor and the painter.  Nothing is more picturesque and graceful than\\na man at work.  The artist who goes to the children’s playground, watches\\nthem at their sport and sees the boy stoop to tie his shoe, will find the\\nsame themes that engaged the attention of the ancient Greeks, and such\\nobservation and the illustrations which follow will do much to correct\\nthat foolish impression that mental and physical beauty are always\\ndivorced.\\n\\nTo you, more than perhaps to any other country, has Nature been generous\\nin furnishing material for art workers to work in.  You have marble\\nquarries where the stone is more beautiful in colour than any the Greeks\\never had for their beautiful work, and yet day after day I am confronted\\nwith the great building of some stupid man who has used the beautiful\\nmaterial as if it were not precious almost beyond speech.  Marble should\\nnot be used save by noble workmen.  There is nothing which gave me a\\ngreater sense of barrenness in travelling through the country than the\\nentire absence of wood carving on your houses.  Wood carving is the\\nsimplest of the decorative arts.  In Switzerland the little barefooted\\nboy beautifies the porch of his father’s house with examples of skill in\\nthis direction.  Why should not American boys do a great deal more and\\nbetter than Swiss boys?\\n\\nThere is nothing to my mind more coarse in conception and more vulgar in\\nexecution than modern jewellery.  This is something that can easily be\\ncorrected.  Something better should be made out of the beautiful gold\\nwhich is stored up in your mountain hollows and strewn along your river\\nbeds.  When I was at Leadville and reflected that all the shining silver\\nthat I saw coming from the mines would be made into ugly dollars, it made\\nme sad.  It should be made into something more permanent.  The golden\\ngates at Florence are as beautiful to-day as when Michael Angelo saw\\nthem.\\n\\nWe should see more of the workman than we do.  We should not be content\\nto have the salesman stand between us—the salesman who knows nothing of\\nwhat he is selling save that he is charging a great deal too much for it.\\nAnd watching the workman will teach that most important lesson—the\\nnobility of all rational workmanship.\\n\\nI said in my last lecture that art would create a new brotherhood among\\nmen by furnishing a universal language.  I said that under its beneficent\\ninfluences war might pass away.  Thinking this, what place can I ascribe\\nto art in our education?  If children grow up among all fair and lovely\\nthings, they will grow to love beauty and detest ugliness before they\\nknow the reason why.  If you go into a house where everything is coarse,\\nyou find things chipped and broken and unsightly.  Nobody exercises any\\ncare.  If everything is dainty and delicate, gentleness and refinement of\\nmanner are unconsciously acquired.  When I was in San Francisco I used to\\nvisit the Chinese Quarter frequently.  There I used to watch a great\\nhulking Chinese workman at his task of digging, and used to see him every\\nday drink his tea from a little cup as delicate in texture as the petal\\nof a flower, whereas in all the grand hotels of the land, where thousands\\nof dollars have been lavished on great gilt mirrors and gaudy columns, I\\nhave been given my coffee or my chocolate in cups an inch and a quarter\\nthick.  I think I have deserved something nicer.\\n\\nThe art systems of the past have been devised by philosophers who looked\\nupon human beings as obstructions.  They have tried to educate boys’\\nminds before they had any.  How much better it would be in these early\\nyears to teach children to use their hands in the rational service of\\nmankind.  I would have a workshop attached to every school, and one hour\\na day given up to the teaching of simple decorative arts.  It would be a\\ngolden hour to the children.  And you would soon raise up a race of\\nhandicraftsmen who would transform the face of your country.  I have seen\\nonly one such school in the United States, and this was in Philadelphia\\nand was founded by my friend Mr. Leyland.  I stopped there yesterday and\\nhave brought some of the work here this afternoon to show you.  Here are\\ntwo disks of beaten brass: the designs on them are beautiful, the\\nworkmanship is simple, and the entire result is satisfactory.  The work\\nwas done by a little boy twelve years old.  This is a wooden bowl\\ndecorated by a little girl of thirteen.  The design is lovely and the\\ncolouring delicate and pretty.  Here you see a piece of beautiful wood\\ncarving accomplished by a little boy of nine.  In such work as this,\\nchildren learn sincerity in art.  They learn to abhor the liar in art—the\\nman who paints wood to look like iron, or iron to look like stone.  It is\\na practical school of morals.  No better way is there to learn to love\\nNature than to understand Art.  It dignifies every flower of the field.\\nAnd, the boy who sees the thing of beauty which a bird on the wing\\nbecomes when transferred to wood or canvas will probably not throw the\\ncustomary stone.  What we want is something spiritual added to life.\\nNothing is so ignoble that Art cannot sanctify it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nART AND THE HANDICRAFTSMAN\\n\\n\\nThe fragments of which this lecture is composed are taken entirely from\\nthe original manuscripts which have but recently been discovered.  It is\\nnot certain that they all belong to the same lecture, nor that all were\\nwritten at the same period.  Some portions were written in Philadelphia\\nin 1882.\\n\\nPEOPLE often talk as if there was an opposition between what is beautiful\\nand what is useful.  There is no opposition to beauty except ugliness:\\nall things are either beautiful or ugly, and utility will be always on\\nthe side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is always\\non the side of the beautiful thing, because beautiful decoration is\\nalways an expression of the use you put a thing to and the value placed\\non it.  No workman will beautifully decorate bad work, nor can you\\npossibly get good handicraftsmen or workmen without having beautiful\\ndesigns.  You should be quite sure of that.  If you have poor and\\nworthless designs in any craft or trade you will get poor and worthless\\nworkmen only, but the minute you have noble and beautiful designs, then\\nyou get men of power and intellect and feeling to work for you.  By\\nhaving good designs you have workmen who work not merely with their hands\\nbut with their hearts and heads too; otherwise you will get merely the\\nfool or the loafer to work for you.\\n\\nThat the beauty of life is a thing of no moment, I suppose few people\\nwould venture to assert.  And yet most civilised people act as if it were\\nof none, and in so doing are wronging both themselves and those that are\\nto come after them.  For that beauty which is meant by art is no mere\\naccident of human life which people can take or leave, but a positive\\nnecessity of life if we are to live as nature meant us to, that is to say\\nunless we are content to be less than men.\\n\\nDo not think that the commercial spirit which is the basis of your life\\nand cities here is opposed to art.  Who built the beautiful cities of the\\nworld but commercial men and commercial men only?  Genoa built by its\\ntraders, Florence by its bankers, and Venice, most lovely of all, by its\\nnoble and honest merchants.\\n\\nI do not wish you, remember, ‘to build a new Pisa,’ nor to bring ‘the\\nlife or the decorations of the thirteenth century back again.’  ‘The\\ncircumstances with which you must surround your workmen are those’ of\\nmodern American life, ‘because the designs you have now to ask for from\\nyour workmen are such as will make modern’ American ‘life beautiful.’\\nThe art we want is the art based on all the inventions of modern\\ncivilisation, and to suit all the needs of nineteenth-century life.\\n\\nDo you think, for instance, that we object to machinery?  I tell you we\\nreverence it; we reverence it when it does its proper work, when it\\nrelieves man from ignoble and soulless labour, not when it seeks to do\\nthat which is valuable only when wrought by the hands and hearts of men.\\nLet us have no machine-made ornament at all; it is all bad and worthless\\nand ugly.  And let us not mistake the means of civilisation for the end\\nof civilisation; steam-engine, telephone and the like, are all wonderful,\\nbut remember that their value depends entirely on the noble uses we make\\nof them, on the noble spirit in which we employ them, not on the things\\nthemselves.\\n\\nIt is, no doubt, a great advantage to talk to a man at the Antipodes\\nthrough a telephone; its advantage depends entirely on the value of what\\nthe two men have to say to one another.  If one merely shrieks slander\\nthrough a tube and the other whispers folly into a wire, do not think\\nthat anybody is very much benefited by the invention.\\n\\nThe train that whirls an ordinary Englishman through Italy at the rate of\\nforty miles an hour and finally sends him home without any memory of that\\nlovely country but that he was cheated by a courier at Rome, or that he\\ngot a bad dinner at Verona, does not do him or civilisation much good.\\nBut that swift legion of fiery-footed engines that bore to the burning\\nruins of Chicago the loving help and generous treasure of the world was\\nas noble and as beautiful as any golden troop of angels that ever fed the\\nhungry and clothed the naked in the antique times.  As beautiful, yes;\\nall machinery may be beautiful when it is undecorated even.  Do not seek\\nto decorate it.  We cannot but think all good machinery is graceful,\\nalso, the line of strength and the line of beauty being one.\\n\\nGive then, as I said, to your workmen of to-day the bright and noble\\nsurroundings that you can yourself create.  Stately and simple\\narchitecture for your cities, bright and simple dress for your men and\\nwomen; those are the conditions of a real artistic movement.  For the\\nartist is not concerned primarily with any theory of life but with life\\nitself, with the joy and loveliness that should come daily on eye and ear\\nfor a beautiful external world.\\n\\nBut the simplicity must not be barrenness nor the bright colour gaudy.\\nFor all beautiful colours are graduated colours, the colours that seem\\nabout to pass into one another’s realm—colour without tone being like\\nmusic without harmony, mere discord.  Barren architecture, the vulgar and\\nglaring advertisements that desecrate not merely your cities but every\\nrock and river that I have seen yet in America—all this is not enough.  A\\nschool of design we must have too in each city.  It should be a stately\\nand noble building, full of the best examples of the best art of the\\nworld.  Furthermore, do not put your designers in a barren whitewashed\\nroom and bid them work in that depressing and colourless atmosphere as I\\nhave seen many of the American schools of design, but give them beautiful\\nsurroundings.  Because you want to produce a permanent canon and standard\\nof taste in your workman, he must have always by him and before him\\nspecimens of the best decorative art of the world, so that you can say to\\nhim: ‘This is good work.  Greek or Italian or Japanese wrought it so many\\nyears ago, but it is eternally young because eternally beautiful.’  Work\\nin this spirit and you will be sure to be right.  Do not copy it, but\\nwork with the same love, the same reverence, the same freedom of\\nimagination.  You must teach him colour and design, how all beautiful\\ncolours are graduated colours and glaring colours the essence of\\nvulgarity.  Show him the quality of any beautiful work of nature like the\\nrose, or any beautiful work of art like an Eastern carpet—being merely\\nthe exquisite gradation of colour, one tone answering another like the\\nanswering chords of a symphony.  Teach him how the true designer is not\\nhe who makes the design and then colours it, but he who designs in\\ncolour, creates in colour, thinks in colour too.  Show him how the most\\ngorgeous stained-glass windows of Europe are filled with white glass, and\\nthe most gorgeous Eastern tapestry with toned colours—the primary colours\\nin both places being set in the white glass, and the tone colours like\\nbrilliant jewels set in dusky gold.  And then as regards design, show him\\nhow the real designer will take first any given limited space, little\\ndisk of silver, it may be, like a Greek coin, or wide expanse of fretted\\nceiling or lordly wall as Tintoret chose at Venice (it does not matter\\nwhich), and to this limited space—the first condition of decoration being\\nthe limitation of the size of the material used—he will give the effect\\nof its being filled with beautiful decoration, filled with it as a golden\\ncup will be filled with wine, so complete that you should not be able to\\ntake away anything from it or add anything to it.  For from a good piece\\nof design you can take away nothing, nor can you add anything to it, each\\nlittle bit of design being as absolutely necessary and as vitally\\nimportant to the whole effect as a note or chord of music is for a sonata\\nof Beethoven.\\n\\nBut I said the effect of its being so filled, because this, again, is of\\nthe essence of good design.  With a simple spray of leaves and a bird in\\nflight a Japanese artist will give you the impression that he has\\ncompletely covered with lovely design the reed fan or lacquer cabinet at\\nwhich he is working, merely because he knows the exact spot in which to\\nplace them.  All good design depends on the texture of the utensil used\\nand the use you wish to put it to.  One of the first things I saw in an\\nAmerican school of design was a young lady painting a romantic moonlight\\nlandscape on a large round dish, and another young lady covering a set of\\ndinner plates with a series of sunsets of the most remarkable colours.\\nLet your ladies paint moonlight landscapes and sunsets, but do not let\\nthem paint them on dinner plates or dishes.  Let them take canvas or\\npaper for such work, but not clay or china.  They are merely painting the\\nwrong subjects on the wrong material, that is all.  They have not been\\ntaught that every material and texture has certain qualities of its own.\\nThe design suitable for one is quite wrong for the other, just as the\\ndesign which you should work on a flat table-cover ought to be quite\\ndifferent from the design you would work on a curtain, for the one will\\nalways be straight, the other broken into folds; and the use too one puts\\nthe object to should guide one in the choice of design.  One does not\\nwant to eat one’s terrapins off a romantic moonlight nor one’s clams off\\na harrowing sunset.  Glory of sun and moon, let them be wrought for us by\\nour landscape artist and be on the walls of the rooms we sit in to remind\\nus of the undying beauty of the sunsets that fade and die, but do not let\\nus eat our soup off them and send them down to the kitchen twice a day to\\nbe washed and scrubbed by the handmaid.\\n\\nAll these things are simple enough, yet nearly always forgotten.  Your\\nschool of design here will teach your girls and your boys, your\\nhandicraftsmen of the future (for all your schools of art should be local\\nschools, the schools of particular cities).  We talk of the Italian\\nschool of painting, but there is no Italian school; there were the\\nschools of each city.  Every town in Italy, from Venice itself, queen of\\nthe sea, to the little hill fortress of Perugia, each had its own school\\nof art, each different and all beautiful.\\n\\nSo do not mind what art Philadelphia or New York is having, but make by\\nthe hands of your own citizens beautiful art for the joy of your own\\ncitizens, for you have here the primary elements of a great artistic\\nmovement.\\n\\nFor, believe me, the conditions of art are much simpler than people\\nimagine.  For the noblest art one requires a clear healthy atmosphere,\\nnot polluted as the air of our English cities is by the smoke and grime\\nand horridness which comes from open furnace and from factory chimney.\\nYou must have strong, sane, healthy physique among your men and women.\\nSickly or idle or melancholy people do not do much in art.  And lastly,\\nyou require a sense of individualism about each man and woman, for this\\nis the essence of art—a desire on the part of man to express himself in\\nthe noblest way possible.  And this is the reason that the grandest art\\nof the world always came from a republic: Athens, Venice, and\\nFlorence—there were no kings there and so their art was as noble and\\nsimple as sincere.  But if you want to know what kind of art the folly of\\nkings will impose on a country look at the decorative art of France under\\nthe _grand monarque_, under Louis the Fourteenth; the gaudy gilt\\nfurniture writhing under a sense of its own horror and ugliness, with a\\nnymph smirking at every angle and a dragon mouthing on every claw.\\nUnreal and monstrous art this, and fit only for such periwigged\\npomposities as the nobility of France at that time, but not at all fit\\nfor you or me.  We do not want the rich to possess more beautiful things\\nbut the poor to create more beautiful things; for ever man is poor who\\ncannot create.  Nor shall the art which you and I need be merely a purple\\nrobe woven by a slave and thrown over the whitened body of some leprous\\nking to adorn or to conceal the sin of his luxury, but rather shall it be\\nthe noble and beautiful expression of a people’s noble and beautiful\\nlife.  Art shall be again the most glorious of all the chords through\\nwhich the spirit of a great nation finds its noblest utterance.\\n\\nAll around you, I said, lie the conditions for a great artistic movement\\nfor every great art.  Let us think of one of them; a sculptor, for\\ninstance.\\n\\nIf a modern sculptor were to come and say, ‘Very well, but where can one\\nfind subjects for sculpture out of men who wear frock-coats and\\nchimney-pot hats?’ I would tell him to go to the docks of a great city\\nand watch the men loading or unloading the stately ships, working at\\nwheel or windlass, hauling at rope or gangway.  I have never watched a\\nman do anything useful who has not been graceful at some moment of his\\nlabour: it is only the loafer and the idle saunterer who is as useless\\nand uninteresting to the artist as he is to himself.  I would ask the\\nsculptor to go with me to any of your schools or universities, to the\\nrunning ground and gymnasium, to watch the young men start for a race,\\nhurling quoit or club, kneeling to tie their shoes before leaping,\\nstepping from the boat or bending to the oar, and to carve them; and when\\nhe was weary of cities I would ask him to come to your fields and meadows\\nto watch the reaper with his sickle and the cattle-driver with lifted\\nlasso.  For if a man cannot find the noblest motives for his art in such\\nsimple daily things as a woman drawing water from the well or a man\\nleaning with his scythe, he will not find them anywhere at all.  Gods and\\ngoddesses the Greek carved because he loved them; saint and king the Goth\\nbecause he believed in them.  But you, you do not care much for Greek\\ngods and goddesses, and you are perfectly and entirely right; and you do\\nnot think much of kings either, and you are quite right.  But what you do\\nlove are your own men and women, your own flowers and fields, your own\\nhills and mountains, and these are what your art should represent to you.\\n\\nOurs has been the first movement which has brought the handicraftsman and\\nthe artist together, for remember that by separating the one from the\\nother you do ruin to both; you rob the one of all spiritual motive and\\nall imaginative joy, you isolate the other from all real technical\\nperfection.  The two greatest schools of art in the world, the sculptor\\nat Athens and the school of painting at Venice, had their origin entirely\\nin a long succession of simple and earnest handicraftsmen.  It was the\\nGreek potter who taught the sculptor that restraining influence of design\\nwhich was the glory of the Parthenon; it was the Italian decorator of\\nchests and household goods who kept Venetian painting always true to its\\nprimary pictorial condition of noble colour.  For we should remember that\\nall the arts are fine arts and all the arts decorative arts.  The\\ngreatest triumph of Italian painting was the decoration of a pope’s\\nchapel in Rome and the wall of a room in Venice.  Michael Angelo wrought\\nthe one, and Tintoret, the dyer’s son, the other.  And the little ‘Dutch\\nlandscape, which you put over your sideboard to-day, and between the\\nwindows to-morrow, is’ no less a glorious ‘piece of work than the extents\\nof field and forest with which Benozzo has made green and beautiful the\\nonce melancholy arcade of the Campo Santo at Pisa,’ as Ruskin says.\\n\\nDo not imitate the works of a nation, Greek or Japanese, Italian or\\nEnglish; but their artistic spirit of design and their artistic attitude\\nto-day, their own world, you should absorb but imitate never, copy never.\\nUnless you can make as beautiful a design in painted china or embroidered\\nscreen or beaten brass out of your American turkey as the Japanese does\\nout of his grey silver-winged stork, you will never do anything.  Let the\\nGreek carve his lions and the Goth his dragons: buffalo and wild deer are\\nthe animals for you.\\n\\nGolden rod and aster and rose and all the flowers that cover your valleys\\nin the spring and your hills in the autumn: let them be the flowers for\\nyour art.  Not merely has Nature given you the noblest motives for a new\\nschool of decoration, but to you above all other countries has she given\\nthe utensils to work in.\\n\\nYou have quarries of marble richer than Pentelicus, more varied than\\nParos, but do not build a great white square house of marble and think\\nthat it is beautiful, or that you are using marble nobly.  If you build\\nin marble you must either carve it into joyous decoration, like the lives\\nof dancing children that adorn the marble castles of the Loire, or fill\\nit with beautiful sculpture, frieze and pediment, as the Greeks did, or\\ninlay it with other coloured marbles as they did in Venice.  Otherwise\\nyou had better build in simple red brick as your Puritan fathers, with no\\npretence and with some beauty.  Do not treat your marble as if it was\\nordinary stone and build a house of mere blocks of it.  For it is indeed\\na precious stone, this marble of yours, and only workmen of nobility of\\ninvention and delicacy of hand should be allowed to touch it at all,\\ncarving it into noble statues or into beautiful decoration, or inlaying\\nit with other coloured marbles: for ‘the true colours of architecture are\\nthose of natural stone, and I would fain see them taken advantage of to\\nthe full.  Every variety is here, from pale yellow to purple passing\\nthrough orange, red, and brown, entirely at your command; nearly every\\nkind of green and grey also is attainable, and with these and with pure\\nwhite what harmony might you not achieve.  Of stained and variegated\\nstone the quantity is unlimited, the kinds innumerable.  Were brighter\\ncolours required, let glass, and gold protected by glass, be used in\\nmosaic, a kind of work as durable as the solid stone and incapable of\\nlosing its lustre by time.  And let the painter’s work be reserved for\\nthe shadowed loggia and inner chamber.\\n\\n‘This is the true and faithful way of building.  Where this cannot be,\\nthe device of external colouring may indeed be employed without\\ndishonour—but it must be with the warning reflection that a time will\\ncome when such aids will pass away and when the building will be judged\\nin its lifelessness, dying the death of the dolphin.  Better the less\\nbright, more enduring fabric.  The transparent alabasters of San Miniato\\nand the mosaics of Saint Mark’s are more warmly filled and more brightly\\ntouched by every return of morning and evening, while the hues of the\\nGothic cathedrals have died like the iris out of the cloud, and the\\ntemples, whose azure and purple once flamed above the Grecian promontory,\\nstand in their faded whiteness like snows which the sunset has left\\ncold.’—Ruskin, _Seven Lamps of Architecture_, II.\\n\\nI do not know anything so perfectly commonplace in design as most modern\\njewellery.  How easy for you to change that and to produce goldsmiths’\\nwork that would be a joy to all of us.  The gold is ready for you in\\nunexhausted treasure, stored up in the mountain hollow or strewn on the\\nriver sand, and was not given to you merely for barren speculation.\\nThere should be some better record of it left in your history than the\\nmerchant’s panic and the ruined home.  We do not remember often enough\\nhow constantly the history of a great nation will live in and by its art.\\nOnly a few thin wreaths of beaten gold remain to tell us of the stately\\nempire of Etruria; and, while from the streets of Florence the noble\\nknight and haughty duke have long since passed away, the gates which the\\nsimple goldsmith Ghiberti made for their pleasure still guard their\\nlovely house of baptism, worthy still of the praise of Michael Angelo who\\ncalled them worthy to be the Gates of Paradise.\\n\\nHave then your school of design, search out your workmen and, when you\\nfind one who has delicacy of hand and that wonder of invention necessary\\nfor goldsmiths’ work, do not leave him to toil in obscurity and dishonour\\nand have a great glaring shop and two great glaring shop-boys in it (not\\nto take your orders: they never do that; but to force you to buy\\nsomething you do not want at all).  When you want a thing wrought in\\ngold, goblet or shield for the feast, necklace or wreath for the women,\\ntell him what you like most in decoration, flower or wreath, bird in\\nflight or hound in the chase, image of the woman you love or the friend\\nyou honour.  Watch him as he beats out the gold into those thin plates\\ndelicate as the petals of a yellow rose, or draws it into the long wires\\nlike tangled sunbeams at dawn.  Whoever that workman be, help him,\\ncherish him, and you will have such lovely work from his hand as will be\\na joy to you for all time.\\n\\nThis is the spirit of our movement in England, and this is the spirit in\\nwhich we would wish you to work, making eternal by your art all that is\\nnoble in your men and women, stately in your lakes and mountains,\\nbeautiful in your own flowers and natural life.  We want to see that you\\nhave nothing in your houses that has not been a joy to the man who made\\nit, and is not a joy to those that use it.  We want to see you create an\\nart made by the hands of the people to please the hearts of the people\\ntoo.  Do you like this spirit or not?  Do you think it simple and strong,\\nnoble in its aim, and beautiful in its result?  I know you do.\\n\\nFolly and slander have their own way for a little time, but for a little\\ntime only.  You now know what we mean: you will be able to estimate what\\nis said of us—its value and its motive.\\n\\nThere should be a law that no ordinary newspaper should be allowed to\\nwrite about art.  The harm they do by their foolish and random writing it\\nwould be impossible to overestimate—not to the artist but to the public,\\nblinding them to all, but harming the artist not at all.  Without them we\\nwould judge a man simply by his work; but at present the newspapers are\\ntrying hard to induce the public to judge a sculptor, for instance, never\\nby his statues but by the way he treats his wife; a painter by the amount\\nof his income and a poet by the colour of his neck-tie.  I said there\\nshould be a law, but there is really no necessity for a new law: nothing\\ncould be easier than to bring the ordinary critic under the head of the\\ncriminal classes.  But let us leave such an inartistic subject and return\\nto beautiful and comely things, remembering that the art which would\\nrepresent the spirit of modern newspapers would be exactly the art which\\nyou and I want to avoid—grotesque art, malice mocking you from every\\ngateway, slander sneering at you from every corner.\\n\\nPerhaps you may be surprised at my talking of labour and the workman.\\nYou have heard of me, I fear, through the medium of your somewhat\\nimaginative newspapers as, if not a ‘Japanese young man,’ at least a\\nyoung man to whom the rush and clamour and reality of the modern world\\nwere distasteful, and whose greatest difficulty in life was the\\ndifficulty of living up to the level of his blue china—a paradox from\\nwhich England has not yet recovered.\\n\\nWell, let me tell you how it first came to me at all to create an\\nartistic movement in England, a movement to show the rich what beautiful\\nthings they might enjoy and the poor what beautiful things they might\\ncreate.\\n\\nOne summer afternoon in Oxford—‘that sweet city with her dreaming\\nspires,’ lovely as Venice in its splendour, noble in its learning as\\nRome, down the long High Street that winds from tower to tower, past\\nsilent cloister and stately gateway, till it reaches that long, grey\\nseven-arched bridge which Saint Mary used to guard (used to, I say,\\nbecause they are now pulling it down to build a tramway and a light\\ncast-iron bridge in its place, desecrating the loveliest city in\\nEngland)—well, we were coming down the street—a troop of young men, some\\nof them like myself only nineteen, going to river or tennis-court or\\ncricket-field—when Ruskin going up to lecture in cap and gown met us.  He\\nseemed troubled and prayed us to go back with him to his lecture, which a\\nfew of us did, and there he spoke to us not on art this time but on life,\\nsaying that it seemed to him to be wrong that all the best physique and\\nstrength of the young men in England should be spent aimlessly on cricket\\nground or river, without any result at all except that if one rowed well\\none got a pewter-pot, and if one made a good score, a cane-handled bat.\\nHe thought, he said, that we should be working at something that would do\\ngood to other people, at something by which we might show that in all\\nlabour there was something noble.  Well, we were a good deal moved, and\\nsaid we would do anything he wished.  So he went out round Oxford and\\nfound two villages, Upper and Lower Hinksey, and between them there lay a\\ngreat swamp, so that the villagers could not pass from one to the other\\nwithout many miles of a round.  And when we came back in winter he asked\\nus to help him to make a road across this morass for these village people\\nto use.  So out we went, day after day, and learned how to lay levels and\\nto break stones, and to wheel barrows along a plank—a very difficult\\nthing to do.  And Ruskin worked with us in the mist and rain and mud of\\nan Oxford winter, and our friends and our enemies came out and mocked us\\nfrom the bank.  We did not mind it much then, and we did not mind it\\nafterwards at all, but worked away for two months at our road.  And what\\nbecame of the road?  Well, like a bad lecture it ended abruptly—in the\\nmiddle of the swamp.  Ruskin going away to Venice, when we came back for\\nthe next term there was no leader, and the ‘diggers,’ as they called us,\\nfell asunder.  And I felt that if there was enough spirit amongst the\\nyoung men to go out to such work as road-making for the sake of a noble\\nideal of life, I could from them create an artistic movement that might\\nchange, as it has changed, the face of England.  So I sought them\\nout—leader they would call me—but there was no leader: we were all\\nsearchers only and we were bound to each other by noble friendship and by\\nnoble art.  There was none of us idle: poets most of us, so ambitious\\nwere we: painters some of us, or workers in metal or modellers,\\ndetermined that we would try and create for ourselves beautiful work: for\\nthe handicraftsman beautiful work, for those who love us poems and\\npictures, for those who love us not epigrams and paradoxes and scorn.\\n\\nWell, we have done something in England and we will do something more.\\nNow, I do not want you, believe me, to ask your brilliant young men, your\\nbeautiful young girls, to go out and make a road on a swamp for any\\nvillage in America, but I think you might each of you have some art to\\npractise.\\n\\n                                * * * * *\\n\\nWe must have, as Emerson said, a mechanical craft for our culture, a\\nbasis for our higher accomplishments in the work of our hands—the\\nuselessness of most people’s hands seems to me one of the most\\nunpractical things.  ‘No separation from labour can be without some loss\\nof power or truth to the seer,’ says Emerson again.  The heroism which\\nwould make on us the impression of Epaminondas must be that of a domestic\\nconqueror.  The hero of the future is he who shall bravely and gracefully\\nsubdue this Gorgon of fashion and of convention.\\n\\nWhen you have chosen your own part, abide by it, and do not weakly try\\nand reconcile yourself with the world.  The heroic cannot be the common\\nnor the common the heroic.  Congratulate yourself if you have done\\nsomething strange and extravagant and broken the monotony of a decorous\\nage.\\n\\nAnd lastly, let us remember that art is the one thing which Death cannot\\nharm.  The little house at Concord may be desolate, but the wisdom of New\\nEngland’s Plato is not silenced nor the brilliancy of that Attic genius\\ndimmed: the lips of Longfellow are still musical for us though his dust\\nbe turning into the flowers which he loved: and as it is with the greater\\nartists, poet and philosopher and song-bird, so let it be with you.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLECTURE TO ART STUDENTS\\n\\n\\nDelivered to the Art students of the Royal Academy at their Club in\\nGolden Square, Westminster, on June 30, 1883.  The text is taken from the\\noriginal manuscript.\\n\\nIN the lecture which it is my privilege to deliver before you to-night I\\ndo not desire to give you any abstract definition of beauty at all.  For\\nwe who are working in art cannot accept any theory of beauty in exchange\\nfor beauty itself, and, so far from desiring to isolate it in a formula\\nappealing to the intellect, we, on the contrary, seek to materialise it\\nin a form that gives joy to the soul through the senses.  We want to\\ncreate it, not to define it.  The definition should follow the work: the\\nwork should not adapt itself to the definition.\\n\\nNothing, indeed, is more dangerous to the young artist than any\\nconception of ideal beauty: he is constantly led by it either into weak\\nprettiness or lifeless abstraction: whereas to touch the ideal at all you\\nmust not strip it of vitality.  You must find it in life and re-create it\\nin art.\\n\\nWhile, then, on the one hand I do not desire to give you any philosophy\\nof beauty—for, what I want to-night is to investigate how we can create\\nart, not how we can talk of it—on the other hand, I do not wish to deal\\nwith anything like a history of English art.\\n\\nTo begin with, such an expression as English art is a meaningless\\nexpression.  One might just as well talk of English mathematics.  Art is\\nthe science of beauty, and Mathematics the science of truth: there is no\\nnational school of either.  Indeed, a national school is a provincial\\nschool, merely.  Nor is there any such thing as a school of art even.\\nThere are merely artists, that is all.\\n\\nAnd as regards histories of art, they are quite valueless to you unless\\nyou are seeking the ostentatious oblivion of an art professorship.  It is\\nof no use to you to know the date of Perugino or the birthplace of\\nSalvator Rosa: all that you should learn about art is to know a good\\npicture when you see it, and a bad picture when you see it.  As regards\\nthe date of the artist, all good work looks perfectly modern: a piece of\\nGreek sculpture, a portrait of Velasquez—they are always modern, always\\nof our time.  And as regards the nationality of the artist, art is not\\nnational but universal.  As regards archæology, then, avoid it\\naltogether: archæology is merely the science of making excuses for bad\\nart; it is the rock on which many a young artist founders and shipwrecks;\\nit is the abyss from which no artist, old or young, ever returns.  Or, if\\nhe does return, he is so covered with the dust of ages and the mildew of\\ntime, that he is quite unrecognisable as an artist, and has to conceal\\nhimself for the rest of his days under the cap of a professor, or as a\\nmere illustrator of ancient history.  How worthless archæology is in art\\nyou can estimate by the fact of its being so popular.  Popularity is the\\ncrown of laurel which the world puts on bad art.  Whatever is popular is\\nwrong.\\n\\nAs I am not going to talk to you, then, about the philosophy of the\\nbeautiful, or the history of art, you will ask me what I am going to talk\\nabout.  The subject of my lecture to-night is what makes an artist and\\nwhat does the artist make; what are the relations of the artist to his\\nsurroundings, what is the education the artist should get, and what is\\nthe quality of a good work of art.\\n\\nNow, as regards the relations of the artist to his surroundings, by which\\nI mean the age and country in which he is born.  All good art, as I said\\nbefore, has nothing to do with any particular century; but this\\nuniversality is the quality of the work of art; the conditions that\\nproduce that quality are different.  And what, I think, you should do is\\nto realise completely your age in order completely to abstract yourself\\nfrom it; remembering that if you are an artist at all, you will be not\\nthe mouthpiece of a century, but the master of eternity, that all art\\nrests on a principle, and that mere temporal considerations are no\\nprinciple at all; and that those who advise you to make your art\\nrepresentative of the nineteenth century are advising you to produce an\\nart which your children, when you have them, will think old-fashioned.\\nBut you will tell me this is an inartistic age, and we are an inartistic\\npeople, and the artist suffers much in this nineteenth century of ours.\\n\\nOf course he does.  I, of all men, am not going to deny that.  But\\nremember that there never has been an artistic age, or an artistic\\npeople, since the beginning of the world.  The artist has always been,\\nand will always be, an exquisite exception.  There is no golden age of\\nart; only artists who have produced what is more golden than gold.\\n\\n_What_, you will say to me, the Greeks? were not they an artistic people?\\n\\nWell, the Greeks certainly not, but, perhaps, you mean the Athenians, the\\ncitizens of one out of a thousand cities.\\n\\nDo you think that they were an artistic people?  Take them even at the\\ntime of their highest artistic development, the latter part of the fifth\\ncentury before Christ, when they had the greatest poets and the greatest\\nartists of the antique world, when the Parthenon rose in loveliness at\\nthe bidding of a Phidias, and the philosopher spake of wisdom in the\\nshadow of the painted portico, and tragedy swept in the perfection of\\npageant and pathos across the marble of the stage.  Were they an artistic\\npeople then?  Not a bit of it.  What is an artistic people but a people\\nwho love their artists and understand their art?  The Athenians could do\\nneither.\\n\\nHow did they treat Phidias?  To Phidias we owe the great era, not merely\\nin Greek, but in all art—I mean of the introduction of the use of the\\nliving model.\\n\\nAnd what would you say if all the English bishops, backed by the English\\npeople, came down from Exeter Hall to the Royal Academy one day and took\\noff Sir Frederick Leighton in a prison van to Newgate on the charge of\\nhaving allowed you to make use of the living model in your designs for\\nsacred pictures?\\n\\nWould you not cry out against the barbarism and the Puritanism of such an\\nidea?  Would you not explain to them that the worst way to honour God is\\nto dishonour man who is made in His image, and is the work of His hands;\\nand, that if one wants to paint Christ one must take the most Christlike\\nperson one can find, and if one wants to paint the Madonna, the purest\\ngirl one knows?\\n\\nWould you not rush off and burn down Newgate, if necessary, and say that\\nsuch a thing was without parallel in history?\\n\\nWithout parallel?  Well, that is exactly what the Athenians did.\\n\\nIn the room of the Parthenon marbles, in the British Museum, you will see\\na marble shield on the wall.  On it there are two figures; one of a man\\nwhose face is half hidden, the other of a man with the godlike lineaments\\nof Pericles.  For having done this, for having introduced into a bas\\nrelief, taken from Greek sacred history, the image of the great statesman\\nwho was ruling Athens at the time, Phidias was flung into prison and\\nthere, in the common gaol of Athens, died, the supreme artist of the old\\nworld.\\n\\nAnd do you think that this was an exceptional case?  The sign of a\\nPhilistine age is the cry of immorality against art, and this cry was\\nraised by the Athenian people against every great poet and thinker of\\ntheir day—Æschylus, Euripides, Socrates.  It was the same with Florence\\nin the thirteenth century.  Good handicrafts are due to guilds, not to\\nthe people.  The moment the guilds lost their power and the people rushed\\nin, beauty and honesty of work died.\\n\\nAnd so, never talk of an artistic people; there never has been such a\\nthing.\\n\\nBut, perhaps, you will tell me that the external beauty of the world has\\nalmost entirely passed away from us, that the artist dwells no longer in\\nthe midst of the lovely surroundings which, in ages past, were the\\nnatural inheritance of every one, and that art is very difficult in this\\nunlovely town of ours, where, as you go to your work in the morning, or\\nreturn from it at eventide, you have to pass through street after street\\nof the most foolish and stupid architecture that the world has ever seen;\\narchitecture, where every lovely Greek form is desecrated and defiled,\\nand every lovely Gothic form defiled and desecrated, reducing\\nthree-fourths of the London houses to being, merely, like square boxes of\\nthe vilest proportions, as gaunt as they are grimy, and as poor as they\\nare pretentious—the hall door always of the wrong colour, and the windows\\nof the wrong size, and where, even when wearied of the houses you turn to\\ncontemplate the street itself, you have nothing to look at but\\nchimney-pot hats, men with sandwich boards, vermilion letter-boxes, and\\ndo that even at the risk of being run over by an emerald-green omnibus.\\n\\nIs not art difficult, you will say to me, in such surroundings as these?\\nOf course it is difficult, but then art was never easy; you yourselves\\nwould not wish it to be easy; and, besides, nothing is worth doing except\\nwhat the world says is impossible.\\n\\nStill, you do not care to be answered merely by a paradox.  What are the\\nrelations of the artist to the external world, and what is the result of\\nthe loss of beautiful surroundings to you, is one of the most important\\nquestions of modern art; and there is no point on which Mr. Ruskin so\\ninsists as that the decadence of art has come from the decadence of\\nbeautiful things; and that when the artist cannot feed his eye on beauty,\\nbeauty goes from his work.\\n\\nI remember in one of his lectures, after describing the sordid aspect of\\na great English city, he draws for us a picture of what were the artistic\\nsurroundings long ago.\\n\\nThink, he says, in words of perfect and picturesque imagery, whose beauty\\nI can but feebly echo, think of what was the scene which presented\\nitself, in his afternoon walk, to a designer of the Gothic school of\\nPisa—Nino Pisano or any of his men: {206}\\n\\n    On each side of a bright river he saw rise a line of brighter\\n    palaces, arched and pillared, and inlaid with deep red porphyry, and\\n    with serpentine; along the quays before their gates were riding\\n    troops of knights, noble in face and form, dazzling in crest and\\n    shield; horse and man one labyrinth of quaint colour and gleaming\\n    light—the purple, and silver, and scarlet fringes flowing over the\\n    strong limbs and clashing mall, like sea-waves over rocks at sunset.\\n    Opening on each side from the river were gardens, courts, and\\n    cloisters; long successions of white pillars among wreaths of vine;\\n    leaping of fountains through buds of pomegranate and orange: and\\n    still along the garden-paths, and under and through the crimson of\\n    the pomegranate shadows, moving slowly, groups of the fairest women\\n    that Italy ever saw—fairest, because purest and thoughtfullest;\\n    trained in all high knowledge, as in all courteous art—in dance, in\\n    song, in sweet wit, in lofty learning, in loftier courage, in\\n    loftiest love—able alike to cheer, to enchant, or save, the souls of\\n    men.  Above all this scenery of perfect human life, rose dome and\\n    bell-tower, burning with white alabaster and gold: beyond dome and\\n    bell-tower the slopes of mighty hills hoary with olive; far in the\\n    north, above a purple sea of peaks of solemn Apennine, the clear,\\n    sharp-cloven Carrara mountains sent up their steadfast flames of\\n    marble summit into amber sky; the great sea itself, scorching with\\n    expanse of light, stretching from their feet to the Gorgonian isles;\\n    and over all these, ever present, near or far—seen through the leaves\\n    of vine, or imaged with all its march of clouds in the Arno’s stream,\\n    or set with its depth of blue close against the golden hair and\\n    burning cheek of lady and knight,—that untroubled and sacred sky,\\n    which was to all men, in those days of innocent faith, indeed the\\n    unquestioned abode of spirits, as the earth was of men; and which\\n    opened straight through its gates of cloud and veils of dew into the\\n    awfulness of the eternal world;—a heaven in which every cloud that\\n    passed was literally the chariot of an angel, and every ray of its\\n    Evening and Morning streamed from the throne of God.\\n\\n    What think you of that for a school of design?\\n\\nAnd then look at the depressing, monotonous appearance of any modern\\ncity, the sombre dress of men and women, the meaningless and barren\\narchitecture, the colourless and dreadful surroundings.  Without a\\nbeautiful national life, not sculpture merely, but all the arts will die.\\n\\nWell, as regards the religious feeling of the close of the passage, I do\\nnot think I need speak about that.  Religion springs from religious\\nfeeling, art from artistic feeling: you never get one from the other;\\nunless you have the right root you will not get the right flower; and, if\\na man sees in a cloud the chariot of an angel, he will probably paint it\\nvery unlike a cloud.\\n\\nBut, as regards the general idea of the early part of that lovely bit of\\nprose, is it really true that beautiful surroundings are necessary for\\nthe artist?  I think not; I am sure not.  Indeed, to me the most\\ninartistic thing in this age of ours is not the indifference of the\\npublic to beautiful things, but the indifference of the artist to the\\nthings that are called ugly.  For, to the real artist, nothing is\\nbeautiful or ugly in itself at all.  With the facts of the object he has\\nnothing to do, but with its appearance only, and appearance is a matter\\nof light and shade, of masses, of position, and of value.\\n\\nAppearance is, in fact, a matter of effect merely, and it is with the\\neffects of nature that you have to deal, not with the real condition of\\nthe object.  What you, as painters, have to paint is not things as they\\nare but things as they seem to be, not things as they are but things as\\nthey are not.\\n\\nNo object is so ugly that, under certain conditions of light and shade,\\nor proximity to other things, it will not look beautiful; no object is so\\nbeautiful that, under certain conditions, it will not look ugly.  I\\nbelieve that in every twenty-four hours what is beautiful looks ugly, and\\nwhat is ugly looks beautiful, once.\\n\\nAnd, the commonplace character of so much of our English painting seems\\nto me due to the fact that so many of our young artists look merely at\\nwhat we may call ‘ready-made beauty,’ whereas you exist as artists not to\\ncopy beauty but to create it in your art, to wait and watch for it in\\nnature.\\n\\nWhat would you say of a dramatist who would take nobody but virtuous\\npeople as characters in his play?  Would you not say he was missing half\\nof life?  Well, of the young artist who paints nothing but beautiful\\nthings, I say he misses one half of the world.\\n\\nDo not wait for life to be picturesque, but try and see life under\\npicturesque conditions.  These conditions you can create for yourself in\\nyour studio, for they are merely conditions of light.  In nature, you\\nmust wait for them, watch for them, choose them; and, if you wait and\\nwatch, come they will.\\n\\nIn Gower Street at night you may see a letter-box that is picturesque: on\\nthe Thames Embankment you may see picturesque policemen.

To the Greeks, for\\ninstance, they were quite unknown.  Mr. Mahaffy, it is true, tells us\\nthat Pericles used to present peacocks to the great ladies of Athenian\\nsociety in order to induce them to sit to his friend Phidias, and we know\\nthat Polygnotus introduced into his picture of the Trojan women the face\\nof Elpinice, the celebrated sister of the great Conservative leader of\\nthe day, but these _grandes dames_ clearly do not come under our\\ncategory.  As for the old masters, they undoubtedly made constant studies\\nfrom their pupils and apprentices, and even their religious pictures are\\nfull of the portraits of their friends and relations, but they do not\\nseem to have had the inestimable advantage of the existence of a class of\\npeople whose sole profession is to pose.  In fact the model, in our sense\\nof the word, is the direct creation of Academic Schools.\\n\\nEvery country now has its own models, except America.  In New York, and\\neven in Boston, a good model is so great a rarity that most of the\\nartists are reduced to painting Niagara and millionaires.  In Europe,\\nhowever, it is different.  Here we have plenty of models, and of every\\nnationality.  The Italian models are the best.  The natural grace of\\ntheir attitudes, as well as the wonderful picturesqueness of their\\ncolouring, makes them facile—often too facile—subjects for the painter’s\\nbrush.  The French models, though not so beautiful as the Italian,\\npossess a quickness of intellectual sympathy, a capacity, in fact, of\\nunderstanding the artist, which is quite remarkable.  They have also a\\ngreat command over the varieties of facial expression, are peculiarly\\ndramatic, and can chatter the _argot_ of the _atelier_ as cleverly as the\\ncritic of the _Gil Blas_.  The English models form a class entirely by\\nthemselves.  They are not so picturesque as the Italian, nor so clever as\\nthe French, and they have absolutely no tradition, so to speak, of their\\norder.  Now and then some old veteran knocks at the studio door, and\\nproposes to sit as Ajax defying the lightning, or as King Lear upon the\\nblasted heath.  One of them some time ago called on a popular painter\\nwho, happening at the moment to require his services, engaged him, and\\ntold him to begin by kneeling down in the attitude of prayer.  ‘Shall I\\nbe Biblical or Shakespearean, sir?’ asked the veteran.\\n‘Well—Shakespearean,’ answered the artist, wondering by what subtle\\n_nuance_ of expression the model would convey the difference.  ‘All\\nright, sir,’ said the professor of posing, and he solemnly knelt down and\\nbegan to wink with his left eye!  This class, however, is dying out.  As\\na rule the model, nowadays, is a pretty girl, from about twelve to\\ntwenty-five years of age, who knows nothing about art, cares less, and is\\nmerely anxious to earn seven or eight shillings a day without much\\ntrouble.  English models rarely look at a picture, and never venture on\\nany æsthetic theories.  In fact, they realise very completely Mr.\\nWhistler’s idea of the function of an art critic, for they pass no\\ncriticisms at all.  They accept all schools of art with the grand\\ncatholicity of the auctioneer, and sit to a fantastic young impressionist\\nas readily as to a learned and laborious academician.  They are neither\\nfor the Whistlerites nor against them; the quarrel between the school of\\nfacts and the school of effects touches them not; idealistic and\\nnaturalistic are words that convey no meaning to their ears; they merely\\ndesire that the studio shall be warm, and the lunch hot, for all charming\\nartists give their models lunch.\\n\\nAs to what they are asked to do they are equally indifferent.  On Monday\\nthey will don the rags of a beggar-girl for Mr. Pumper, whose pathetic\\npictures of modern life draw such tears from the public, and on Tuesday\\nthey will pose in a peplum for Mr. Phoebus, who thinks that all really\\nartistic subjects are necessarily B.C.  They career gaily through all\\ncenturies and through all costumes, and, like actors, are interesting\\nonly when they are not themselves.  They are extremely good-natured, and\\nvery accommodating.  ‘What do you sit for?’ said a young artist to a\\nmodel who had sent him in her card (all models, by the way, have cards\\nand a small black bag).  ‘Oh, for anything you like, sir,’ said the girl,\\n‘landscape if necessary!’\\n\\nIntellectually, it must be acknowledged, they are Philistines, but\\nphysically they are perfect—at least some are.  Though none of them can\\ntalk Greek, many can look Greek, which to a nineteenth-century painter is\\nnaturally of great importance.  If they are allowed, they chatter a great\\ndeal, but they never say anything.  Their observations are the only\\n_banalités_ heard in Bohemia.  However, though they cannot appreciate the\\nartist as artist, they are quite ready to appreciate the artist as a man.\\nThey are very sensitive to kindness, respect and generosity.  A beautiful\\nmodel who had sat for two years to one of our most distinguished English\\npainters, got engaged to a street vendor of penny ices.\\n\\nOn her marriage the painter sent her a pretty wedding present, and\\nreceived in return a nice letter of thanks with the following remarkable\\npostscript: ‘Never eat the green ices!’\\n\\nWhen they are tired a wise artist gives them a rest.  Then they sit in a\\nchair and read penny dreadfuls, till they are roused from the tragedy of\\nliterature to take their place again in the tragedy of art.  A few of\\nthem smoke cigarettes.  This, however, is regarded by the other models as\\nshowing a want of seriousness, and is not generally approved of.  They\\nare engaged by the day and by the half-day.  The tariff is a shilling an\\nhour, to which great artists usually add an omnibus fare.  The two best\\nthings about them are their extraordinary prettiness, and their extreme\\nrespectability.  As a class they are very well behaved, particularly\\nthose who sit for the figure, a fact which is curious or natural\\naccording to the view one takes of human nature.  They usually marry\\nwell, and sometimes they marry the artist.  For an artist to marry his\\nmodel is as fatal as for a _gourmet_ to marry his cook: the one gets no\\nsittings, and the other gets no dinners.\\n\\nOn the whole the English female models are very naïve, very natural, and\\nvery good-humoured.  The virtues which the artist values most in them are\\nprettiness and punctuality.  Every sensible model consequently keeps a\\ndiary of her engagements, and dresses neatly.  The bad season is, of\\ncourse, the summer, when the artists are out of town.  However, of late\\nyears some artists have engaged their models to follow them, and the wife\\nof one of our most charming painters has often had three or four models\\nunder her charge in the country, so that the work of her husband and his\\nfriends should not be interrupted.  In France the models migrate _en\\nmasse_ to the little seaport villages or forest hamlets where the\\npainters congregate.  The English models, however, wait patiently in\\nLondon, as a rule, till the artists come back.  Nearly all of them live\\nwith their parents, and help to support the house.  They have every\\nqualification for being immortalised in art except that of beautiful\\nhands.  The hands of the English model are nearly always coarse and red.\\n\\nAs for the male models, there is the veteran whom we have mentioned\\nabove.  He has all the traditions of the grand style, and is rapidly\\ndisappearing with the school he represents.  An old man who talks about\\nFuseli is, of course, unendurable, and, besides, patriarchs have ceased\\nto be fashionable subjects.  Then there is the true Academy model.  He is\\nusually a man of thirty, rarely good-looking, but a perfect miracle of\\nmuscles.  In fact he is the apotheosis of anatomy, and is so conscious of\\nhis own splendour that he tells you of his tibia and his thorax, as if no\\none else had anything of the kind.  Then come the Oriental models.  The\\nsupply of these is limited, but there are always about a dozen in London.\\nThey are very much sought after as they can remain immobile for hours,\\nand generally possess lovely costumes.  However, they have a very poor\\nopinion of English art, which they regard as something between a vulgar\\npersonality and a commonplace photograph.  Next we have the Italian youth\\nwho has come over specially to be a model, or takes to it when his organ\\nis out of repair.  He is often quite charming with his large melancholy\\neyes, his crisp hair, and his slim brown figure.  It is true he eats\\ngarlic, but then he can stand like a faun and couch like a leopard, so he\\nis forgiven.  He is always full of pretty compliments, and has been known\\nto have kind words of encouragement for even our greatest artists.  As\\nfor the English lad of the same age, he never sits at all.  Apparently he\\ndoes not regard the career of a model as a serious profession.  In any\\ncase he is rarely, if ever, to be got hold of.  English boys, too, are\\ndifficult to find.  Sometimes an ex-model who has a son will curl his\\nhair, and wash his face, and bring him the round of the studios, all soap\\nand shininess.  The young school don’t like him, but the older school do,\\nand when he appears on the walls of the Royal Academy he is called _The\\nInfant Samuel_.  Occasionally also an artist catches a couple of _gamins_\\nin the gutter and asks them to come to his studio.  The first time they\\nalways appear, but after that they don’t keep their appointments.  They\\ndislike sitting still, and have a strong and perhaps natural objection to\\nlooking pathetic.  Besides, they are always under the impression that the\\nartist is laughing at them.  It is a sad fact, but there is no doubt that\\nthe poor are completely unconscious of their own picturesqueness.  Those\\nof them who can be induced to sit do so with the idea that the artist is\\nmerely a benevolent philanthropist who has chosen an eccentric method of\\ndistributing alms to the undeserving.  Perhaps the School Board will\\nteach the London _gamin_ his own artistic value, and then they will be\\nbetter models than they are now.  One remarkable privilege belongs to the\\nAcademy model, that of extorting a sovereign from any newly elected\\nAssociate or R.A.  They wait at Burlington House till the announcement is\\nmade, and then race to the hapless artist’s house.  The one who arrives\\nfirst receives the money.  They have of late been much troubled at the\\nlong distances they have had to run, and they look with disfavour on the\\nelection of artists who live at Hampstead or at Bedford Park, for it is\\nconsidered a point of honour not to employ the underground railway,\\nomnibuses, or any artificial means of locomotion.  The race is to the\\nswift.\\n\\nBesides the professional posers of the studio there are posers of the\\nRow, the posers at afternoon teas, the posers in politics and the circus\\nposers.  All four classes are delightful, but only the last class is ever\\nreally decorative.  Acrobats and gymnasts can give the young painter\\ninfinite suggestions, for they bring into their art an element of\\nswiftness of motion and of constant change that the studio model\\nnecessarily lacks.  What is interesting in these ‘slaves of the ring’ is\\nthat with them Beauty is an unconscious result not a conscious aim, the\\nresult in fact of the mathematical calculation of curves and distances,\\nof absolute precision of eye, of the scientific knowledge of the\\nequilibrium of forces, and of perfect physical training.  A good acrobat\\nis always graceful, though grace is never his object; he is graceful\\nbecause he does what he has to do in the best way in which it can be\\ndone—graceful because he is natural.  If an ancient Greek were to come to\\nlife now, which considering the probable severity of his criticisms would\\nbe rather trying to our conceit, he would be found far oftener at the\\ncircus than at the theatre.  A good circus is an oasis of Hellenism in a\\nworld that reads too much to be wise, and thinks too much to be\\nbeautiful.  If it were not for the running-ground at Eton, the\\ntowing-path at Oxford, the Thames swimming-baths, and the yearly\\ncircuses, humanity would forget the plastic perfection of its own form,\\nand degenerate into a race of short-sighted professors and spectacled\\n_précieuses_.  Not that the circus proprietors are, as a rule, conscious\\nof their high mission.  Do they not bore us with the _haute école_, and\\nweary us with Shakespearean clowns?  Still, at least, they give us\\nacrobats, and the acrobat is an artist.  The mere fact that he never\\nspeaks to the audience shows how well he appreciates the great truth that\\nthe aim of art is not to reveal personality but to please.  The clown may\\nbe blatant, but the acrobat is always beautiful.  He is an interesting\\ncombination of the spirit of Greek sculpture with the spangles of the\\nmodern costumier.  He has even had his niche in the novels of our age,\\nand if _Manette Salomon_ be the unmasking of the model, _Les Frères\\nZemganno_ is the apotheosis of the acrobat.\\n\\nAs regards the influence of the ordinary model on our English school of\\npainting, it cannot be said that it is altogether good.  It is, of\\ncourse, an advantage for the young artist sitting in his studio to be\\nable to isolate ‘a little corner of life,’ as the French say, from\\ndisturbing surroundings, and to study it under certain effects of light\\nand shade.  But this very isolation leads often to mere mannerism in the\\npainter, and robs him of that broad acceptance of the general facts of\\nlife which is the very essence of art.  Model-painting, in a word, while\\nit may be the condition of art, is not by any means its aim.\\n\\nIt is simply practice, not perfection.  Its use trains the eye and the\\nhand of the painter, its abuse produces in his work an effect of mere\\nposing and prettiness.  It is the secret of much of the artificiality of\\nmodern art, this constant posing of pretty people, and when art becomes\\nartificial it becomes monotonous.  Outside the little world of the\\nstudio, with its draperies and its _bric-à-brac_, lies the world of life\\nwith its infinite, its Shakespearean variety.  We must, however,\\ndistinguish between the two kinds of models, those who sit for the figure\\nand those who sit for the costume.  The study of the first is always\\nexcellent, but the costume-model is becoming rather wearisome in modern\\npictures.  It is really of very little use to dress up a London girl in\\nGreek draperies and to paint her as a goddess.  The robe may be the robe\\nof Athens, but the face is usually the face of Brompton.  Now and then,\\nit is true, one comes across a model whose face is an exquisite\\nanachronism, and who looks lovely and natural in the dress of any century\\nbut her own.  This, however, is rather rare.  As a rule models are\\nabsolutely _de notre siècle_, and should be painted as such.\\nUnfortunately they are not, and, as a consequence, we are shown every\\nyear a series of scenes from fancy dress balls which are called\\nhistorical pictures, but are little more than mediocre representations of\\nmodern people masquerading.  In France they are wiser.  The French\\npainter uses the model simply for study; for the finished picture he goes\\ndirect to life.\\n\\nHowever, we must not blame the sitters for the shortcomings of the\\nartists.  The English models are a well-behaved and hard-working class,\\nand if they are more interested in artists than in art, a large section\\nof the public is in the same condition, and most of our modern\\nexhibitions seem to justify its choice.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPOEMS IN PROSE\\n\\n\\n_Fortnight Review_, July 1894.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE ARTIST\\n\\n\\nONE evening there came into his soul the desire to fashion an image of\\n_The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.  And he went forth into the\\nworld to look for bronze.  For he could think only in bronze.\\n\\nBut all the bronze of the whole world had disappeared, nor anywhere in\\nthe whole world was there any bronze to be found, save only the bronze of\\nthe image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_.\\n\\nNow this image he had himself, and with his own hands, fashioned, and had\\nset it on the tomb of the one thing he had loved in life.  On the tomb of\\nthe dead thing he had most loved had he set this image of his own\\nfashioning, that it might serve as a sign of the love of man that dieth\\nnot, and a symbol of the sorrow of man that endureth for ever.  And in\\nthe whole world there was no other bronze save the bronze of this image.\\n\\nAnd he took the image he had fashioned, and set it in a great furnace,\\nand gave it to the fire.\\n\\nAnd out of the bronze of the image of _The Sorrow that endureth for Ever_\\nhe fashioned an image of _The Pleasure that abideth for a Moment_.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DOER OF GOOD\\n\\n\\nIt was night-time and He was alone.\\n\\nAnd He saw afar-off the walls of a round city and went towards the city.\\n\\nAnd when He came near He heard within the city the tread of the feet of\\njoy, and the laughter of the mouth of gladness and the loud noise of many\\nlutes.  And He knocked at the gate and certain of the gate-keepers opened\\nto Him.\\n\\nAnd He beheld a house that was of marble and had fair pillars of marble\\nbefore it.  The pillars were hung with garlands, and within and without\\nthere were torches of cedar.  And He entered the house.\\n\\nAnd when He had passed through the hall of chalcedony and the hall of\\njasper, and reached the long hall of feasting, He saw lying on a couch of\\nsea-purple one whose hair was crowned with red roses and whose lips were\\nred with wine.\\n\\nAnd He went behind him and touched him on the shoulder and said to him,\\n‘Why do you live like this?’\\n\\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him, and made answer and\\nsaid, ‘But I was a leper once, and you healed me.  How else should I\\nlive?’\\n\\nAnd He passed out of the house and went again into the street.\\n\\nAnd after a little while He saw one whose face and raiment were painted\\nand whose feet were shod with pearls.  And behind her came, slowly as a\\nhunter, a young man who wore a cloak of two colours.  Now the face of the\\nwoman was as the fair face of an idol, and the eyes of the young man were\\nbright with lust.\\n\\nAnd He followed swiftly and touched the hand of the young man and said to\\nhim, ‘Why do you look at this woman and in such wise?’\\n\\nAnd the young man turned round and recognised Him and said, ‘But I was\\nblind once, and you gave me sight.  At what else should I look?’\\n\\nAnd He ran forward and touched the painted raiment of the woman and said\\nto her, ‘Is there no other way in which to walk save the way of sin?’\\n\\nAnd the woman turned round and recognised Him, and laughed and said, ‘But\\nyou forgave me my sins, and the way is a pleasant way.’\\n\\nAnd He passed out of the city.\\n\\nAnd when He had passed out of the city He saw seated by the roadside a\\nyoung man who was weeping.\\n\\nAnd He went towards him and touched the long locks of his hair and said\\nto him, ‘Why are you weeping?’\\n\\nAnd the young man looked up and recognised Him and made answer, ‘But I\\nwas dead once, and you raised me from the dead.  What else should I do\\nbut weep?’\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE DISCIPLE\\n\\n\\nWhen Narcissus died the pool of his pleasure changed from a cup of sweet\\nwaters into a cup of salt tears, and the Oreads came weeping through the\\nwoodland that they might sing to the pool and give it comfort.\\n\\nAnd when they saw that the pool had changed from a cup of sweet waters\\ninto a cup of salt tears, they loosened the green tresses of their hair\\nand cried to the pool and said, ‘We do not wonder that you should mourn\\nin this manner for Narcissus, so beautiful was he.’\\n\\n‘But was Narcissus beautiful?’ said the pool.\\n\\n‘Who should know that better than you?’ answered the Oreads.  ‘Us did he\\never pass by, but you he sought for, and would lie on your banks and look\\ndown at you, and in the mirror of your waters he would mirror his own\\nbeauty.’\\n\\nAnd the pool answered, ‘But I loved Narcissus because, as he lay on my\\nbanks and looked down at me, in the mirror of his eyes I saw ever my own\\nbeauty mirrored.’\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE MASTER\\n\\n\\nNow when the darkness came over the earth Joseph of Arimathea, having\\nlighted a torch of pinewood, passed down from the hill into the valley.\\nFor he had business in his own home.\\n\\nAnd kneeling on the flint stones of the Valley of Desolation he saw a\\nyoung man who was naked and weeping.  His hair was the colour of honey,\\nand his body was as a white flower, but he had wounded his body with\\nthorns and on his hair had he set ashes as a crown.\\n\\nAnd he who had great possessions said to the young man who was naked and\\nweeping, ‘I do not wonder that your sorrow is so great, for surely He was\\na just man.’\\n\\nAnd the young man answered, ‘It is not for Him that I am weeping, but for\\nmyself.  I too have changed water into wine, and I have healed the leper\\nand given sight to the blind.  I have walked upon the waters, and from\\nthe dwellers in the tombs I have cast out devils.  I have fed the hungry\\nin the desert where there was no food, and I have raised the dead from\\ntheir narrow houses, and at my bidding, and before a great multitude, of\\npeople, a barren fig-tree withered away.  All things that this man has\\ndone I have done also.  And yet they have not crucified me.’\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE HOUSE OF JUDGMENT\\n\\n\\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment, and the Man came naked\\nbefore God.\\n\\nAnd God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\\n\\nAnd God said to the Man, ‘Thy life hath been evil, and thou hast shown\\ncruelty to those who were in need of succour, and to those who lacked\\nhelp thou hast been bitter and hard of heart.  The poor called to thee\\nand thou didst not hearken, and thine ears were closed to the cry of My\\nafflicted.  The inheritance of the fatherless thou didst take unto\\nthyself, and thou didst send the foxes into the vineyard of thy\\nneighbour’s field.  Thou didst take the bread of the children and give it\\nto the dogs to eat, and My lepers who lived in the marshes, and were at\\npeace and praised Me, thou didst drive forth on to the highways, and on\\nMine earth out of which I made thee thou didst spill innocent blood.’\\n\\nAnd the Man made answer and said, ‘Even so did I.’\\n\\nAnd again God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\\n\\nAnd God said to the Man, ‘Thy life hath been evil, and the Beauty I have\\nshown thou hast sought for, and the Good I have hidden thou didst pass\\nby.  The walls of thy chamber were painted with images, and from the bed\\nof thine abominations thou didst rise up to the sound of flutes.  Thou\\ndidst build seven altars to the sins I have suffered, and didst eat of\\nthe thing that may not be eaten, and the purple of thy raiment was\\nbroidered with the three signs of shame.  Thine idols were neither of\\ngold nor of silver that endure, but of flesh that dieth.  Thou didst\\nstain their hair with perfumes and put pomegranates in their hands.  Thou\\ndidst stain their feet with saffron and spread carpets before them.  With\\nantimony thou didst stain their eyelids and their bodies thou didst smear\\nwith myrrh.  Thou didst bow thyself to the ground before them, and the\\nthrones of thine idols were set in the sun.  Thou didst show to the sun\\nthy shame and to the moon thy madness.’\\n\\nAnd the Man made answer and said, ‘Even so did I.’\\n\\nAnd a third time God opened the Book of the Life of the Man.\\n\\nAnd God said to the Man, ‘Evil hath been thy life, and with evil didst\\nthou requite good, and with wrongdoing kindness.  The hands that fed thee\\nthou didst wound, and the breasts that gave thee suck thou didst despise.\\nHe who came to thee with water went away thirsting, and the outlawed men\\nwho hid thee in their tents at night thou didst betray before dawn.\\nThine enemy who spared thee thou didst snare in an ambush, and the friend\\nwho walked with thee thou didst sell for a price, and to those who\\nbrought thee Love thou didst ever give Lust in thy turn.’\\n\\nAnd the Man made answer and said, ‘Even so did I.’\\n\\nAnd God closed the Book of the Life of the Man, and said, ‘Surely I will\\nsend thee into Hell.  Even into Hell will I send thee.’\\n\\nAnd the Man cried out, ‘Thou canst not.’\\n\\nAnd God said to the Man, ‘Wherefore can I not send thee to Hell, and for\\nwhat reason?’\\n\\n‘Because in Hell have I always lived,’ answered the Man.\\n\\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.\\n\\nAnd after a space God spake, and said to the Man, ‘Seeing that I may not\\nsend thee into Hell, surely I will send thee unto Heaven.  Even unto\\nHeaven will I send thee.’\\n\\nAnd the Man cried out, ‘Thou canst not.’\\n\\nAnd God said to the Man, ‘Wherefore can I not send thee unto Heaven, and\\nfor what reason?’\\n\\n‘Because never, and in no place, have I been able to imagine it,’\\nanswered the Man.\\n\\nAnd there was silence in the House of Judgment.\\n\\n\\n\\nTHE TEACHER OF WISDOM\\n\\n\\nFrom his childhood he had been as one filled with the perfect knowledge\\nof God, and even while he was yet but a lad many of the saints, as well\\nas certain holy women who dwelt in the free city of his birth, had been\\nstirred to much wonder by the grave wisdom of his answers.\\n\\nAnd when his parents had given him the robe and the ring of manhood he\\nkissed them, and left them and went out into the world, that he might\\nspeak to the world about God.  For there were at that time many in the\\nworld who either knew not God at all, or had but an incomplete knowledge\\nof Him, or worshipped the false gods who dwell in groves and have no care\\nof their worshippers.\\n\\nAnd he set his face to the sun and journeyed, walking without sandals, as\\nhe had seen the saints walk, and carrying at his girdle a leathern wallet\\nand a little water-bottle of burnt clay.\\n\\nAnd as he walked along the highway he was full of the joy that comes from\\nthe perfect knowledge of God, and he sang praises unto God without\\nceasing; and after a time he reached a strange land in which there were\\nmany cities.\\n\\nAnd he passed through eleven cities.  And some of these cities were in\\nvalleys, and others were by the banks of great rivers, and others were\\nset on hills.  And in each city he found a disciple who loved him and\\nfollowed him, and a great multitude also of people followed him from each\\ncity, and the knowledge of God spread in the whole land, and many of the\\nrulers were converted, and the priests of the temples in which there were\\nidols found that half of their gain was gone, and when they beat upon\\ntheir drums at noon none, or but a few, came with peacocks and with\\nofferings of flesh as had been the custom of the land before his coming.\\n\\nYet the more the people followed him, and the greater the number of his\\ndisciples, the greater became his sorrow.  And he knew not why his sorrow\\nwas so great.  For he spake ever about God, and out of the fulness of\\nthat perfect knowledge of God which God had Himself given to him.\\n\\nAnd one evening he passed out of the eleventh city, which was a city of\\nArmenia, and his disciples and a great crowd of people followed after\\nhim; and he went up on to a mountain and sat down on a rock that was on\\nthe mountain, and his disciples stood round him, and the multitude knelt\\nin the valley.\\n\\nAnd he bowed his head on his hands and wept, and said to his Soul, ‘Why\\nis it that I am full of sorrow and fear, and that each of my disciples is\\nan enemy that walks in the noonday?’  And his Soul answered him and said,\\n‘God filled thee with the perfect knowledge of Himself, and thou hast\\ngiven this knowledge away to others.  The pearl of great price thou hast\\ndivided, and the vesture without seam thou hast parted asunder.  He who\\ngiveth away wisdom robbeth himself.  He is as one who giveth his treasure\\nto a robber.  Is not God wiser than thou art?  Who art thou to give away\\nthe secret that God hath told thee?  I was rich once, and thou hast made\\nme poor.  Once I saw God, and now thou hast hidden Him from me.’\\n\\nAnd he wept again, for he knew that his Soul spake truth to him, and that\\nhe had given to others the perfect knowledge of God, and that he was as\\none clinging to the skirts of God, and that his faith was leaving him by\\nreason of the number of those who believed in him.\\n\\nAnd he said to himself, ‘I will talk no more about God.  He who giveth\\naway wisdom robbeth himself.’\\n\\nAnd after the space of some hours his disciples came near him and bowed\\nthemselves to the ground and said, ‘Master, talk to us about God, for\\nthou hast the perfect knowledge of God, and no man save thee hath this\\nknowledge.’\\n\\nAnd he answered them and said, ‘I will talk to you about all other things\\nthat are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not talk to you.\\nNeither now, nor at any time, will I talk to you about God.’\\n\\nAnd they were wroth with him and said to him, ‘Thou hast led us into the\\ndesert that we might hearken to thee.  Wilt thou send us away hungry, and\\nthe great multitude that thou hast made to follow thee?’\\n\\nAnd he answered them and said, ‘I will not talk to you about God.’\\n\\nAnd the multitude murmured against him and said to him, ‘Thou hast led us\\ninto the desert, and hast given us no food to eat.  Talk to us about God\\nand it will suffice us.’\\n\\nBut he answered them not a word.  For he knew that if he spake to them\\nabout God he would give away his treasure.\\n\\nAnd his disciples went away sadly, and the multitude of people returned\\nto their own homes.  And many died on the way.\\n\\nAnd when he was alone he rose up and set his face to the moon, and\\njourneyed for seven moons, speaking to no man nor making any answer.  And\\nwhen the seventh moon had waned he reached that desert which is the\\ndesert of the Great River.  And having found a cavern in which a Centaur\\nhad once dwelt, he took it for his place of dwelling, and made himself a\\nmat of reeds on which to lie, and became a hermit.  And every hour the\\nHermit praised God that He had suffered him to keep some knowledge of Him\\nand of His wonderful greatness.\\n\\nNow, one evening, as the Hermit was seated before the cavern in which he\\nhad made his place of dwelling, he beheld a young man of evil and\\nbeautiful face who passed by in mean apparel and with empty hands.  Every\\nevening with empty hands the young man passed by, and every morning he\\nreturned with his hands full of purple and pearls.  For he was a Robber\\nand robbed the caravans of the merchants.\\n\\nAnd the Hermit looked at him and pitied him.  But he spake not a word.\\nFor he knew that he who speaks a word loses his faith.\\n\\nAnd one morning, as the young man returned with his hands full of purple\\nand pearls, he stopped and frowned and stamped his foot upon the sand,\\nand said to the Hermit: ‘Why do you look at me ever in this manner as I\\npass by?  What is it that I see in your eyes?  For no man has looked at\\nme before in this manner.  And the thing is a thorn and a trouble to me.’\\n\\nAnd the Hermit answered him and said, ‘What you see in my eyes is pity.\\nPity is what looks out at you from my eyes.’\\n\\nAnd the young man laughed with scorn, and cried to the Hermit in a bitter\\nvoice, and said to him, ‘I have purple and pearls in my hands, and you\\nhave but a mat of reeds on which to lie.  What pity should you have for\\nme?  And for what reason have you this pity?’\\n\\n‘I have pity for you,’ said the Hermit, ‘because you have no knowledge of\\nGod.’\\n\\n‘Is this knowledge of God a precious thing?’ asked the young man, and he\\ncame close to the mouth of the cavern.\\n\\n‘It is more precious than all the purple and the pearls of the world,’\\nanswered the Hermit.\\n\\n‘And have you got it?’ said the young Robber, and he came closer still.\\n\\n‘Once, indeed,’ answered the Hermit, ‘I possessed the perfect knowledge\\nof God.  But in my foolishness I parted with it, and divided it amongst\\nothers.  Yet even now is such knowledge as remains to me more precious\\nthan purple or pearls.’\\n\\nAnd when the young Robber heard this he threw away the purple and the\\npearls that he was bearing in his hands, and drawing a sharp sword of\\ncurved steel he said to the Hermit, ‘Give me, forthwith this knowledge of\\nGod that you possess, or I will surely slay you.  Wherefore should I not\\nslay him who has a treasure greater than my treasure?’\\n\\nAnd the Hermit spread out his arms and said, ‘Were it not better for me\\nto go unto the uttermost courts of God and praise Him, than to live in\\nthe world and have no knowledge of Him?  Slay me if that be your desire.\\nBut I will not give away my knowledge of God.’\\n\\nAnd the young Robber knelt down and besought him, but the Hermit would\\nnot talk to him about God, nor give him his Treasure, and the young\\nRobber rose up and said to the Hermit, ‘Be it as you will.  As for\\nmyself, I will go to the City of the Seven Sins, that is but three days’\\njourney from this place, and for my purple they will give me pleasure,\\nand for my pearls they will sell me joy.’  And he took up the purple and\\nthe pearls and went swiftly away.\\n\\nAnd the Hermit cried out and followed him and besought him.  For the\\nspace of three days he followed the young Robber on the road and\\nentreated him to return, nor to enter into the City of the Seven Sins.\\n\\nAnd ever and anon the young Robber looked back at the Hermit and called\\nto him, and said, ‘Will you give me this knowledge of God which is more\\nprecious than purple and pearls?  If you will give me that, I will not\\nenter the city.’\\n\\nAnd ever did the Hermit answer, ‘All things that I have I will give thee,\\nsave that one thing only.  For that thing it is not lawful for me to give\\naway.’\\n\\nAnd in the twilight of the third day they came nigh to the great scarlet\\ngates of the City of the Seven Sins.  And from the city there came the\\nsound of much laughter.\\n\\nAnd the young Robber laughed in answer, and sought to knock at the gate.\\nAnd as he did so the Hermit ran forward and caught him by the skirts of\\nhis raiment, and said to him: ‘Stretch forth your hands, and set your\\narms around my neck, and put your ear close to my lips, and I will give\\nyou what remains to me of the knowledge of God.’  And the young Robber\\nstopped.\\n\\nAnd when the Hermit had given away his knowledge of God, he fell upon the\\nground and wept, and a great darkness hid from him the city and the young\\nRobber, so that he saw them no more.\\n\\nAnd as he lay there weeping he was ware of One who was standing beside\\nhim; and He who was standing beside him had feet of brass and hair like\\nfine wool.  And He raised the Hermit up, and said to him: ‘Before this\\ntime thou hadst the perfect knowledge of God.  Now thou shalt have the\\nperfect love of God.  Wherefore art thou weeping?’  And he kissed him.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFOOTNOTES\\n\\n\\n{29}  Plato’s _Laws_; Æschylus’ _Prometheus Bound_.\\n\\n{31}  Somewhat in the same spirit Plato, in his _Laws_, appeals to the\\nlocal position of Ilion among the rivers of the plain, as a proof that it\\nwas not built till long after the Deluge.\\n\\n{32}  Plutarch remarks that the _only_ evidence Greece possesses of the\\ntruth that the legendary power of Athens is no ‘romance or idle story,’\\nis the public and sacred buildings.  This is an instance of the\\nexaggerated importance given to ruins against which Thucydides is warning\\nus.\\n\\n{37}  The fictitious sale in the Roman marriage _per coemptionem_ was\\noriginally, of course, a real sale.\\n\\n{43}  Notably, of course, in the case of heat and its laws.\\n\\n{57}  Cousin errs a good deal in this respect.  To say, as he did, ‘Give\\nme the latitude and the longitude of a country, its rivers and its\\nmountains, and I will deduce the race,’ is surely a glaring exaggeration.\\n\\n{59}  The monarchical, aristocratical, and democratic elements of the\\nRoman constitution are referred to.\\n\\n{63a}  Polybius, vi. 9.  _αὔτη πολιτειῶν ἀνακύκλωσις_, _αὔτς φύσεως\\nοἰκονομία_.\\n\\n{63b}  _χωρὶς ὀργῆς ἢ φθόνου ποιούμεηος τὴν ἀπόφασιν_.\\n\\n{63c}  The various stages are _σύστασις_, _αὔξησις_, _ἀκμή_, _μεταβολὴ\\nἐις τοὔμπαλιν_.\\n\\n{68}  Polybius, xii. 24.\\n\\n{69a}  Polybius, i. 4, viii. 4, specially; and really _passim_.\\n\\n{69b}  He makes one exception.\\n\\n{69c}  Polybius, viii. 4.\\n\\n{71}  Polybius, xvi. 12.\\n\\n{72a}  Polybius, viii. 4: _τὸ παραδοξάτον καθ’ ἡμᾶς ἔργον ἡ τύχη\\nσυνετέλεσε_; _τοῦτο δ’ ἔστι τὸ πάντα τὰ γνωριζόμενα μέρη τῆς οἰκουμένης\\nὑπὸ μίαν ἀρχὴν καὶ δυναστείαν ἀγαγεῖν_, _ὂ πρότερον οὐχ εὑρίσκεται\\nγεγονός_.\\n\\n{72b}  Polybius resembled Gibbon in many respects.  Like him he held that\\nall religions were to the philosopher equally false, to the vulgar\\nequally true, to the statesman equally useful.\\n\\n{76}  Cf.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\\nLiterary Archive Foundation\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\\nstatus with the IRS.\\n\\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\\napproach us with offers to donate.\\n\\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\\n\\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\\n\\n\\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\\nworks.\\n\\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\\n\\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\\n\\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\\n\\n     www.gutenberg.org\\n\\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\\n']"
